<p>1835, <i>April 6th.</i>—I arrived at Fathīghar, at the house of a
relative in the Civil Service, the Judge of the Station, and agent
to the Governor-general. After a hot and dusty dāk trip, how
delightful was the coolness of the rooms, in which thermantidotes
and tattīs were in full force! As may be naturally supposed,
I could talk of nothing but Khāsgunge, and favoured the party
with some Hindustanī airs on the sitar, which I could not persuade
them to admire; to silence my sitar a dital harp was
presented to me; nevertheless, I retained a secret fondness for
the native instrument, which recalled the time when the happy
slave girls figured before me.</p>

<p>Having seen Musulmānī ladies followers of the Prophet, how
great was my delight at finding native ladies were, at Fathīghar,
worshippers of Ganesh and Krishnjee!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>Her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī, the widow of the late Mahārāj
Dāolut Rāo Scindia, was in camp at this place, under the care
of Captain Ross. Dāolut Rāo, the adopted son and grand-nephew
of Mahadajee Scindia, contested with the Duke of
Wellington, then Sir Arthur Wellesley, the memorable field of
Assaye. On the death of Scindia, by his appointment, the
Bāiza Bā’ī, having become Queen of Gwalior, ruled the kingdom
for nine years. Having no male issue, her Highness adopted a
youth, called Jankee Rāo, a distant relative of Scindia’s, who
was to be placed on the masnad at her decease.</p>

<p>A Rajpoot is of age at eighteen years: but when Jankee Rāo
was only fourteen years old, the subjects of the Bā’ī revolted, and
placed the boy at the head of the rebellion. Had her Highness
remained at Gwalior she would have been murdered; she was
forced to fly to Fathīghar, where she put herself under the protection
of the Government. Her daughter, the Chimna Rājā
Sāhib, a lady celebrated for her beauty, and the wife of Appa
Sāhib, a Mahratta nobleman, died of fever, brought on by
exposure and anxiety at the time she fled from Gwalior, during
the rebellion. It is remarkable, that the ladies in this family
take the title of <i>Rājā</i>, to which Sāhib is generally affixed.
Appa Sāhib joined the Bāiza Bā’ī, fled with her, and is now in
her camp at Fathīghar. The rebellion of her subjects, and her
Highness being forced to fly the kingdom, were nothing to the
Bā’ī in comparison to the grief occasioned her by the loss of
her beloved daughter, the Chimna Rājā.</p>

<p>Her grand-daughter, the Gaja Rājā Sāhib, is also living with
her; she has been married two years, but is alone, her husband
having deserted her to join the stronger party.</p>

<p>The Bā’ī, although nominally free, is in fact a prisoner; she
is extremely anxious to return to Gwalior, but is prevented by
the refusal of the Government to allow her to do so; this renders
her very unhappy.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—The Brija Bā’ī, one of her ladies, called to invite the
lady with whom I am staying to visit the Mahārāj in camp;
and gave me an invitation to accompany her.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—When the appointed day arrived, the attendants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
her Highness were at our house at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, to escort us to
the camp.</p>

<p>It is customary for a visitor to leave her shoes outside the
parda, when paying her respects to a lady of rank; and this
custom is always complied with, unless especial leave to retain
the shoes has been voluntarily given to the visitor, which
would be considered a mark of great kindness and condescension.</p>

<p>We found her Highness seated on her gaddī of embroidered
cloth, with her grand-daughter the Gaja Rājā Sāhib at her side;
the ladies, her attendants, were standing around her; and the
sword of Scindia was on the gaddī, at her feet. She rose to
receive and embrace us, and desired us to be seated near her.
The Bāiza Bā’ī is rather an old woman, with grey hair, and <i>en
bon point</i>; she must have been pretty in her youth; her smile is
remarkably sweet, and her manners particularly pleasing; her
hands and feet are very small, and beautifully formed. Her
sweet voice reminded me of the proverb, “A pleasant voice
brings a snake out of a hole<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.” She was dressed in the plainest
red silk, wore no ornaments, with the exception of a pair of
small plain bars of gold as bracelets. Being a widow, she is
obliged to put jewellery aside, and to submit to numerous
privations and hardships. Her countenance is very mild and
open; there is a freedom and independence in her air that I
greatly admire,—so unlike that of the sleeping, languid, opium-eating
Musalmānīs. Her grand-daughter, the Gaja Rājā Sāhib,
is very young; her eyes the largest I ever saw; her face is rather
flat, and not pretty; her figure is beautiful; she is the least
little wee creature you ever beheld. The Mahratta dress consists
only of two garments, which are, a tight body to the waist, with
sleeves tight to the elbow; a piece of silk, some twenty yards or
more in length, which they wind around them as a petticoat, and
then, taking a part of it, draw it between the limbs, and fasten
it behind, in a manner that gives it the effect both of petticoat
and trowsers; this is the whole dress, unless, at times, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
substitute angiyas, with short sleeves, for the tight long-sleeved
body.</p>

<p>The Gaja Rājā was dressed in purple Benares silk, with a deep
gold border woven into it; when she walked she looked very
graceful, and the dress very elegant; on her forehead was a mark
like a spear-head, in red paint; her hair was plaited, and bound
into a knot at the back of her head, and low down; her eyes
were edged with surma, and her hands and feet dyed with hinnā.
On her feet and ancles were curious silver ornaments; toe-rings
of peculiar form; which she sometimes wore of gold, sometimes
of red coral. In her nostril was a very large and brilliant n’hut
(nose-ring), of diamonds, pearls, and precious stones, of the
particular shape worn by the Mahrattas; in her ears were fine
brilliants. From her throat to her waist she was covered with
strings of magnificent pearls and jewels; her hands and arms
were ornamented with the same. She spoke but little,—scarcely
five words passed her lips; she appeared timid, but was pleased
with the bouquet of beautiful flowers, just fresh from the garden,
that the lady who presented me laid at her feet on her entrance.
These Mahrattas are a fine bold race; amongst her ladies in
waiting I remarked several fine figures, but their faces were
generally too flat. Some of them stood in waiting with rich
Cashmere shawls thrown over their shoulders; one lady, before
the Mahārāj, leaned on her sword, and if the Bā’ī quitted the
apartment, the attendant and sword always followed her. The
Bā’ī was speaking of horses, and the lady who introduced me
said I was as fond of horses as a Mahratta. Her Highness said
she should like to see an English lady on horseback; she could
not comprehend how they could sit all crooked, all on one side,
in the side-saddle. I said I should be too happy to ride into
camp any hour her Highness would appoint, and show her the
style of horsemanship practised by ladies in England. The
Mahārāj expressed a wish that I should be at the Mahratta camp
at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, in two days’ time. Atr, in a silver filagree vessel, was
then presented to the Gaja Rājā; she took a portion up in a
little spoon, and put it on our hands. One of the attendants
presented us with pān, whilst another sprinkled us most copiously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
with rose-water: the more you inundate your visitor with rose-water,
the greater the compliment.</p>

<p>This being the signal for departure, we rose, made our bahut
bahut adab salām, and departed, highly gratified with our visit
to her Highness the ex-Queen of Gwalior.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—My relative had a remarkably beautiful Arab, and as
I wished to show the Bā’ī a good horse, she being an excellent
judge, I requested him to allow me to ride his Arab; and that
he might be fresh, I sent him on to await my arrival at the
zenāna gates. A number of Mahratta horsemen having been
despatched by her Highness to escort me to the camp, I cantered
over with them on my little black horse, and found the beautiful
Arab impatiently awaiting my arrival.</p>

<p><i>Leetle</i> Paul’s description of his “courser proud” is beautiful;
but his steed was not more beautiful than the Arab, who,
adorned with a garland of freshly-gathered white double jasmine
flowers, pawed impatiently at the gates. I mounted him, and
entering the precincts of the zenāna, found myself in a large
court, where all the ladies of the ex-Queen were assembled, and
anxiously looking for the English lady, who would ride crooked!
The Bā’ī was seated in the open air; I rode up, and, dismounting,
paid my respects. She remarked the beauty of the Arab, felt
the hollow under his jaw, admired his eye, and, desiring one of
the ladies to take up his foot, examined it, and said he had the
small, black, hard foot of the pure Arab; she examined and
laughed at my saddle. I then mounted, and putting the Arab
on his mettle, showed her how English ladies manage their
horses. When this was over, three of the Bāiza Bā’ī’s own
riding horses were brought out by the female attendants; for we
were within the zenāna, where no man is allowed to enter. The
horses were in full caparison, the saddles covered with velvet and
kimkhwab and gold embroidery, their heads and necks ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
with jewels and chains of gold. The Gaja Rājā, in her Mahratta
riding dress, mounted one of the horses, and the ladies the others;
they cantered and pranced about, showing off the Mahratta style of
riding. On dismounting, the young Gaja Rājā threw her horse’s
bridle over my arm, and said, laughingly, “Are you afraid? or
will you try my horse?” Who could resist such a challenge?
“I shall be delighted,” was my reply. “You cannot ride like
a Mahratta in that dress,” said the Princess; “put on proper
attire.” I retired to obey her commands, returning in Mahratta
costume, mounted her horse, put my feet into the great iron
stirrups, and started away for a gallop round the enclosure. I
thought of Queen Elizabeth, and her stupidity in changing the
style of riding for women. <i>En cavalier</i>, it appeared so safe,
as if I could have jumped over the moon. Whilst I was thus
amusing myself, “Shāh-bāsh! shāh-bāsh!” exclaimed some masculine
voice; but who pronounced the words, or where the
speaker lay <i>perdu</i>, I have never discovered.</p>

<p>“Now,” said I to the Gaja Rājā, “having obeyed your commands,
will you allow one of your ladies to ride on my side-saddle?”
My habit was put on one of them; how ugly she
looked! “She is like a black doctor!” exclaimed one of the
girls. The moment I got the lady into the saddle, I took the
rein in my hand, and riding by her side, started her horse off in
a canter; she hung on one side, and could not manage it at all;
suddenly checking her horse, I put him into a sharp trot. The
poor lady hung half off the animal, clinging to the pummel, and
screaming to me to stop; but I took her on most unmercifully,
until we reached the spot where the Bāiza Bā’ī was seated; the
walls rang with laughter; the lady dismounted, and vowed she
would never again attempt to sit on such a vile crooked thing as
a side-saddle. It caused a great deal of amusement in the
camp.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Qui vit sans folie n’est pas si sage qu’il croit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Mahratta ladies live in parda, but not in such strict seclusion
as the Musalmānī ladies; they are allowed to ride on horseback
veiled; when the Gaja Rājā goes out on horseback, she is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
attended by her ladies; and a number of Mahratta horsemen
ride at a certain distance, about two hundred yards around her,
to see that the kurk is enforced; which is an order made public
that no man may be seen on the road on pain of death.</p>

<p>The Hindoos never kept their women in parda, until their
country was conquered by the Muhammadans; when they were
induced to follow the fashion of their conquerors; most likely,
from their unveiled women being subject to insult.</p>

<p>The Bāiza Bā’ī did me the honour to express herself pleased,
and gave me a title, “The Great-aunt of my Grand-daughter,”
“Gaja Rājā Sāhib ki par Khāla.” This was very complimentary,
since it entitled me to rank as the adopted sister of her
Highness.</p>

<p>A part of the room in which the ex-Queen sits is formed into
a domestic temple, where the idols are placed, ornamented with
flowers, and worshipped; at night they are lighted up with
lamps of oil, and the priests are in attendance.</p>

<p>The Mahratta ladies are very fond of sailing on the river, but
they are equally in parda in the boats as on shore.</p>

<p>The next day the Bāiza Bā’ī sent down all her horses in
their gay native trappings, for me to look at; also two fine
rhinoceroses, which galloped about the grounds in their heavy
style, and fought one another; the Bā’ī gave five thousand
rupees (£500) for the pair; sweetmeats and oranges pleased the
great animals very much.</p>

<p>When Captain Ross quitted, her Highness was placed under
the charge of the agent to the Governor-general. I visited the
Bā’ī several times, and liked her better than any native lady I
ever met with.</p>

<p>A Hindoo widow is subject to great privations; she is not
allowed to wear gay attire or jewels, and her mourning is eternal.
The Bāiza Bā’ī always slept on the ground, according to the
custom for a widow, until she became very ill from rheumatic
pains; after which she allowed herself a hard mattress, which
was placed on the ground; a charpāī being considered too great
a luxury.</p>

<p>She never smoked, which surprised me: having seen the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Musalmānī ladies so fond of a hooqŭ, I concluded the Mahratta
ladies indulged in the same luxury.</p>

<p>The Mahratta men smoke the hooqŭ as much as all other
natives, and the Bā’ī had a recipe for making tobacco cakes,
that were highly esteemed in camp. The cakes are, in diameter,
about four inches by one inch in thickness; a small quantity
added to the prepared tobacco usually smoked in a hooqŭ
imparts great fragrance; the ingredients are rather difficult to
procure<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of the privations endured by Hindoo widows, her
Highness mentioned that all luxurious food was denied them, as
well as a bed; and their situation was rendered as painful as
possible. She asked me how an English widow fared?</p>

<p>I told her, “An English lady enjoyed all the luxury of her
husband’s house during his life; but, on his death, she was
turned out of the family mansion, to make room for the heir,
and pensioned off; whilst the old horse was allowed the run of
the park, and permitted to finish his days amidst the pastures
he loved in his prime.” The Hindoo widow, however young,
must not marry again.</p>

<p>The fate of women and of melons is alike. “Whether the
melon falls on the knife or the knife on the melon, the melon is
the sufferer<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.”</p>

<p>We spoke of the severity of the laws of England with respect
to married women, how completely <i>by law</i> they are the slaves of
their husbands, and how little hope there is of redress.</p>

<p>You might as well “Twist a rope of sand<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,” or “Beg a
husband of a widow<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>,” as urge the men to emancipate the
white slaves of England.</p>

<p>“Who made the laws?” said her Highness. I looked at her
with surprise, knowing she could not be ignorant on the subject.
“The men,” said I; “why did the Mahārāj ask the question?”
“I doubted it,” said the Bā’ī, with an arch smile, “since they
only allow themselves one wife.”</p>

<p>“England is so small,” I replied, “in comparison with your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Highness’s Gwalior; if every man were allowed four wives, and
obliged to keep them separate, the little island could never contain
them; they would be obliged to keep the women in vessels
off the shore, after the fashion in which the Chinese keep their
floating farm-yards of ducks and geese at anchor.”</p>

<p>“Is your husband angry with you?” asked the Brija, the
favourite attendant of her Highness. “Why should you imagine
it?” said I. “Because you have on no ornaments, no
jewellery.”</p>

<p>The Bāiza Bā’ī sent for the wives of Appa Sāhib to introduce
them to me. The ladies entered, six in number; and walking
up to the gaddī, on which the Bā’ī was seated, each gracefully
bowed her head, until her forehead touched the feet of her
Highness. They were fine young women, from fifteen to twenty-five
years old. The five first wives had no offspring; the sixth,
who had been lately married, was in expectation of a bābā.</p>

<p>Appa Sāhib is the son-in-law of the ex-Queen; he married
her daughter, the Chimna Bā’ī, who died of fever at the time
they were driven out of Gwalior.</p>

<h3>SUPERSTITIONS OF THE NATIVES.</h3>

<p>The natives are extremely superstitious respecting the lucky
and unlucky marks on horses. The following are some of the
marks best known, respecting which their ideas are curious:</p>

<p>The <i>favourable</i> marks are the deōband, the bhora, and the
panch kalian.</p>

<p>The <i>unlucky</i> marks or aiibs are the sampan, siyah-tālū, small
eyes, and a star of a particular sort on the forehead.</p>

<p>The deōband is the feather on the chest: this mark is very
rare, and the best of all marks. If a horse have the deōband,
it is the rok or antidote to the sampan and all other bad
marks.</p>

<p>The bhorahs are the two feathers, one on each side of the
neck, just under the mane. If there be two bhorahs turning
towards the ears of the horse it is favourable, a very good sign.
If there be only one bhora it is tolerably good. If the feather
turn <i>towards the rider</i> it is called the sampan; a bhora on one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
side and a sampan on the other neutralizes both bad and good
qualities.</p>

<p>The panch kalian. The natives admire a <i>panch-kalian</i>, as they
call it, very much, that is, a horse with five marks, as follows:—all
four legs white to the knees, stockings as they are called,
and a white muzzle with a white blaze from the muzzle up the
forehead. According to my idea, such a horse in appearance is
only fit for a butcher’s tray. Nevertheless, the natives admire
them, and I have seen many good horses of this description.</p>

<p>The sampan. When the feather on the neck of a horse on
either side turns towards the rider, it is called sampan; this is a
very bad mark, indeed the worst; but, if there be two sampans,
one on each side the neck, have nothing to say to the animal,
he is an Harām-zāda, given to rearing and squalling; is vicious,
and will be the death of his rider.</p>

<p>The siyah-tālū or black palate is a very bad sign; such horses
are regularly bad, and are never to be depended upon: no
native will purchase an animal having, as it is usually called,
the <i>shatāloo</i>.</p>

<p>Small eyes are the sign of a sulky horse.</p>

<p>The star on the forehead. No native will purchase a horse
if he can cover the star on the forehead with the <i>ball</i> of his
thumb. And in buying a horse from a native, look to that
mark, as they take the white hairs out with a certain application.
A large star is a good sign. No star at all is of no consequence;
but a few white hairs proclaim a bad horse, and no native will
buy him.</p>

<p>With respect to the colour of horses, they are fanciful.
Greys are admired: black horses are also considered handsome:
bays are good: chestnuts very bad.</p>

<p>With regard to Arabs, they are extremely particular as to the
perfect straightness of the forehead, from the top of it down to
the nose; the slightest rise on that part proving in their ideas a
want of perfect pedigree. The deep hollow under the jaw is
absolutely necessary; the small mouth, and the open, large,
thin-skinned nostrils; the eyes large and fine; the hoof small,
black, and hard; and the long tail. These points attract the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
particular attention of the natives. “Bay in all his eight
joints<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.” Horses of that colour are esteemed hardy and active.</p>

<p>The prophet judged shicàl bad in a horse: shicàl is, when a
horse has the right hind-foot and the left fore-foot, or the right
fore-foot and the left hind-foot, white.</p>

<p>The amble of a native horse is a quiet, quick pace, but not
agreeable at first to one accustomed to the paces of horses
broken in by Europeans: the Mahratta bit is extremely sharp,
and throws a horse well on his haunches.</p>

<p>I have seen a young horse, being taught to amble, with a
rope tied to each fetlock; it made him take short steps, moving
the two legs of the same side at the same time; it is a natural
pace to a horse over-loaded.</p>

<p>Horses in India are usually fastened with two ropes to the
head stall, and the two hind-legs have a rope fastened on each
fetlock, which rope is secured to a stake behind the animal,
long enough to allow of his lying down: these are called āgārī-pichhārī.</p>

<p>In Shakespear’s Dictionary, hirdāwal is mentioned as the
name of a defect in horses, and its being a feather or curling
lock of hair on the breast, which is reckoned unlucky for the
rider.</p>

<p>It is written, speaking of the Prophet Mohammud, “There
was nothing his Highness was so fond of, after women, as
horses; and after horses as perfumes; and the marks of good
horses are these: the best horses are black, with white foreheads,
and having a white upper lip; next to that, a black
horse, with white forehead and three white legs; next to this is
a bay horse of these marks: a bay, with white forehead, white
fore and hind legs, is best; and a sorrel with white fore and
hind legs is also good. Prosperity is with sorrel horses. I
heard the Prophet say, ‘Do not cut the hair of your horses’
foreheads, nor of their necks, nor of their tails; because verily
horses keep the flies off with their tails, and their manes cover
their necks, and blessings are interwoven with the hair of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
foreheads,’ ‘Tie up your horses and make them fat for
fighting, and wipe off the dust from their foreheads and rumps;
and tie bells to their necks.’”</p>

<p>This latter command is curious, as in the “Rites of Travelling”
it is mentioned, “The angels are not with that party
with which is a dog, nor with that party with which is a bell.”
“A bell is the devil’s musical instrument.” “Kill black dogs
having two white spots upon their eyes; for verily this kind of
dog is the devil.”</p>

<p>The natives cannot understand why Europeans cut off the tails
of their horses, and consider it a disgusting and absurd practice.
An officer in the artillery related a story of having sold an old
Persian horse, with a tail sweeping the ground, to a friend at
Fathīghar. When the sā’īs returned, Captain A⸺ asked
him how the horse was liked, and if he was well. “Ahi,
Sāhib!” said the sā’īs, “I had no sooner delivered him up than
they cut off his tail, and the poor old horse was of such high
caste that he could not bear such an indignity, and next morning
he died of shame!” “Sharmandī ho mar-gayā.” The
English may be a very civilized nation, but this cutting off the
tails of their horses, nicking the bone, and scoring fish alive,
savour somewhat of barbarism: all that can be urged in its
defence is, it is the custom (dastūr).</p>

<p>The natives are extremely superstitious, and delight in incantations.
“God save you, uncle!” is the address of a Hindoo
to a goblin, of which he is afraid, to prevent its hurting him<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī, having heard of the great fame
of my cabinet of curiosities, requested some tigers’ claws for the
Gaja Rājā. I wrote to a friend in Assam, who sent me a quart
of tigers’ claws! regretting he was unable to procure more.
If you kill a tiger, the servants steal his claws as quickly as
possible to send to their wives to make into charms, which both
the women and children wear around their necks. They avert
the evil eye and keep off maladies. The Gaja Rājā was
pleased at having procured the claws, and her horse’s neck was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
adorned with some five-and-twenty ornaments or more strung
together, each made like the one appended to the chain in the
sketch; it must have been valuable, being formed of pure gold.</p>

<p>The charm, No. 1 in the sketch, I had made by my own workman
in the bazār, in solid silver, a copy from a necklace worn
by the wife of one of my servants Dilmīr Khān. “Not one, but
seventy misfortunes it keeps off<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.” The tiger’s claws are
tipped and set in silver; the back opens with a hinge, and the
Jadu-ke-Bāt, a written charm, is therein concealed, the efficacy
of which, added to the claws, ensures certain prosperity to
the possessor, and averts the evil eye. No lady in India can
wear any thing so valueless as silver, of which the ornaments
made for her servants are composed. Whether Musalmānī or
Hindoo, the women are delighted with the claws of the tiger.
When an amulet, in form like No. 2 in the sketch, is made for
a child, two of the teeth of the crocodile are put into it in lieu
of tigers’ claws. To-day a child in the Fort met its death by
accident. The natives say, “How could it be lucky when it
wore no charm to protect it?” Baghnā is the name for the
amulet consisting of the teeth and claws of a tiger, which are
hung round the neck of a grown-up person or of a child.</p>

<p>The Prophet forbids the use of certain amulets, saying,
“Verily, spells, and tying to the necks of children the nails of
tearing animals, and the thread which is tied round a wife’s neck,
to make her husband love her, are all of the way of the polytheists.”</p>

<p>“It is the custom in Hindoostan to keep a monkey in or near
a stable, to guard the horses from the influence of evil eyes. In
Persia, the animal so retained is a hog; and in some parts of
England, a goat is considered a necessary appendage to a stable,
though, possibly, from some other equally fanciful motive.”</p>

<p>The owl is considered an unlucky bird. “One-eyed men
have a vein extra<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>;” and are supposed to be more knowing than
others. And I have before mentioned that an opinion prevails
in wild and mountainous parts of India, that the spirit of a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
destroyed by a tiger sometimes rides upon his head, and guides
him from his pursuers.</p>

<p>I have never seen it done in India, but I have heard from very
good authority, that there are men who profess to be able to
tame the most vicious horse by whispering into his ear; a man
will go up to a violent animal, whisper to it, and the creature
will become tranquil. Catlin, in his account of the North
American Indians, says: “After having caught a wild horse
with a lasso, the Indian gradually advances until he is able to
place his hand on the animal’s nose, and over its eyes, and at
length to breathe in its nostrils; when it soon becomes docile
and conquered, so that he has little else to do than to remove
the hobbles from its feet, and lead or ride it into camp.” And
in another part of the work, Catlin says: “I have often, in concurrence
with a known custom of the country, held my hands
over the eyes of the calf, and breathed a few strong breaths into
its nostrils; after which I have, with my hunting companions,
rode several miles into our encampment, with the little prisoner
busily following the heels of my horse the whole way, as closely
and as affectionately as its instinct would attach it to the company
of its dam! This is one of the most extraordinary things I
have met with in this wild country; and although I had often
heard of it, and felt unable exactly to believe it, I am now willing
to bear testimony to the fact, from the numerous instances I
have witnessed since I came into the country.”</p>

<p>In explanation of the coin, marked No. 9, in the plate entitled
“<a href="#plate30">Superstitions of the Natives</a>,” I must give an extract from the
letter of a friend:—</p>

<p>“To entertain that amenity so requisite for the obtaining a
note from you, I send, under the seal wherewith I seal my letter,
‘a little money,’ as a first instalment. The form of the coin is
meant to be octagonal; that form is more evident on those that
are larger. Now for the coin’s explanation: It bears the seal of
Rajah Gowrinath Singh, who succeeded his father Luckhishingh,
in Assam, 1780; he was of a hot temper, and a liberal. After
reigning five years, he was expelled by Bhurrethi Moran Rajah
of Bengmoran. Gowrinath Singh fled to Gowhatty, and having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
got the Company to take his part, Captain Wallis was sent with
an armed force to reinstate him on the throne; this was performed,
but at the cost of incredible destruction of towns, villages,
cultivation, and all that sort of thing. Since those days, Assam
has been a jungle. Finding Rungpore, his capital, depopulated,
Gowrinath caused a palace to be built on the banks of the
Deshoi, where he lived in tranquillity ten years; the place became
populous, and though the palace has fallen into ruins, it still
exists as a town, under the name of Deshoi Khote. Gowrinath
Singh died in 1795, having reigned in Assam fifteen years.
I will send you his inscription, which is in part only on the coin
enclosed; but I must get it from my learned Pundit. Other and
older coins are found, both of gold and silver, but of no
baser metal; copper appears to have been unknown for that
purpose.”</p>

<p>No. 10 is the larger octagonal coin mentioned in the above
extract, and was forwarded to me as a second instalment from
Assam.</p>

</div>

<p>1835, <i>April 15th.</i>—I received an invitation to pay my respects
to the Begam Moktar Mahal, the mother of the Nawab of
Fathīgar; she is connected with Mulka Begam’s family, but
very unlike her, having none of her beauty, and not being a
lady-like person. Thence we went to the grandmother of the
Nawab, Surfuraz Mahal, in the same zenāna. They were in
mourning for a death in the family, and wept, according to
dastūr (custom), all the time I was there: they were dressed in
plain white attire, with no ornaments; that is their (mátim)
mourning. The young Nawab, who is about twelve years old,
is a fine boy; ugly, but manly and well-behaved.</p>

<p>The Nawab Mootuzim Adowlah Menhdī Ali Khan Bahādur,
commonly called Nawab Hakīm Menhdī, lives at Fathīgar; he
was unwell, and unable to call, but he sent down his stud to be
shown to me, my fondness for horses having reached his ears.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—I visited a manufactory for Indian shawls, lately
established by the Hakīm to support some people, who, having
come from Cashmir, were in distress; and as they were originally
shawl manufacturers, in charity he gave them employment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
This good deed is not without its reward; three or four hundred
workmen are thus supported; the wool is brought from
Cashmir, and the sale of the shawls gives a handsome profit.
I did not admire them; they are manufactured to suit the
taste of the English, and are too heavy; but they are handsome,
and the patterns strictly Indian. Colonel Gardner’s Begam said
to me one day, at Khāsgunge, “Look at these shawls, how
beautiful they are! If you wish to judge of an Indian shawl,
shut your eyes and feel it; the touch is the test of a good one.
Such shawls as these are not made at the present day in Cashmir;
the English have spoiled the market. The shawls made
now are very handsome, but so thick and heavy, they are only
fit for carpets, not for ladies’ attire.”</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—The Nawāb Hakīm Menhdī called, bringing with him
his son, a man about forty years of age, called “The General.”
He invited me to pay him and the Begam a visit, and wished to
show me his residence.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—We drove to the Nawāb’s house, which is a good one;
he received us at the door, and took <i>my</i> arm, instead of giving
me his. He is a fine-looking old man, older than Colonel
Gardner, whom in style he somewhat resembles; his manners
are distinguished and excellent. He wore an embroidered cap,
with a silver muslin twisted like a cord, and put around it, as a
turban; it was very graceful, and his dress was of white muslin.
The rooms of his house are most curious; more like a shop in
the China bazār, in Calcutta, than any thing else; full of lumber,
mixed with articles of value. Tables were spread all down the
centre of the room, covered with most heterogeneous articles:
round the room were glass cases, full of clocks, watches, sundials,
compasses, guns, pistols, swords; every thing you can
imagine might be found in these cases.</p>

<p>The Hakīm was making all due preparation for celebrating
the Muharram in the most splendid style; he was a very religious
man, and kept the fast with wonderful strictness and fortitude.
A very lofty room was fitted up as a Taziya Khāna, or house of
mourning; from the ceiling hung chandeliers of glass of every
colour, as thickly as it was possible to place them, all the length<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
of the spacious apartment; and in this room several taziyas,
very highly decorated, were placed in readiness for the ceremony.
One of them was a representation of the Mausoleum of the
Prophet at Medina; another the tomb of Hussein at Karbala;
a third, that of Kasīm; and there was also a most splendid
Burāk, a fac-simile of the winged horse, on which the Prophet
made an excursion one night from Jerusalem to Heaven, and
thence returned to Mecca. The angel Gabriel acted as celestial
sā’īs on the occasion, and brought the animal from the regions
above. He must have been a fiery creature to control that
winged horse; and the effect must have been <i>more</i> than picturesque,
as the Prophet scudded along on a steed that had the
eyes and face of a man, his ears long, his forehead broad, and
shining like the moon; eyes of jet, shaped like those of a deer,
and brilliant as the stars; the neck and breast of a swan, the
loins of a lion, the tail and the wings of a peacock, the stature
of a mule, and the speed of lightning!—hence its name Burāk.</p>

<p>In front of the taziyas and of the flying horse were a number
of standards; some intended to be fac-similes of the banner
(’alam) of Hussein: and others having the names of particular
martyrs. The banners of Alī were denominated, “The Palm of
the Hand of Alī the Elect;” “The Hand of the Lion of God;”
“The Palm of the Displayer of Wonders;” and “The Palm of
the Disperser of Difficulties.” Then there was the “Standard of
Fatima,” the daughter of the Prophet, and wife of Alī; also
that of Abbās-i-’alam-dār, the standard-bearer; with those of
Kasīm, Alī-akbar, and others; the banner of the twelve Imāms;
the double-bladed sword of Alī; and the nal-sāhib. There was
also the neza, a spear or lance dressed up with a turban, the ends
flying in the air, and a lime fixed at the top of it; emblematic,
it is said, of Hussein’s head, which was carried in triumph
through different cities, by the order of Yuzeed, the King of
Shawm.</p>

<p>The nal-sāhib is a horse-shoe affixed to the end of a long
pole; it is made of gold, silver, metals, wood, or paper, and is
intended as an emblem of Hussein’s horse.</p>

<p>The ’Alam-i-Kasīm, or Standard of Kasīm the Bridegroom, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
distinguished by its having a little chatr in gold or silver, fixed
on the top of it. All these things were collected in the long
room in the house of the Nawāb, ready for the nocturnal perambulations
of the faithful.</p>

<p>After the loss of the battle of Kraabaallah, the family of
Hussein were carried away captive with his son Zein-ool-Abaīdīn,
the only male of the race of Alī who was spared, and they were
sent to Medina. With them were carried the heads of the
martyrs; and that of Hussein was displayed on the point of a
lance, as the cavalcade passed through the cities. In consequence
of the remonstrances and eloquence of Zein-ool-Abaīdīn, the
orphan son of Hussein, the heads of the martyrs were given
to him; and forty days after the battle they were brought
back to Kraabaallah, and buried, each with its own body; the
mourners then returned to Medina, visited the tomb of the
Prophet, and all Medina eventually became subject to Zein-ool-Abaīdīn.</p>

<p>Alī, the son-in-law of Muhammad, was, according to the
Shī’as, the direct successor of the Prophet; they not acknowledging
the other three caliphs; but, according to the Sunnīs,
he was the fourth Khalifa, or successor of Muhammad.</p>

<p>The Muharram concludes on the fortieth day, in commemoration
of the interment of the martyrs at Kraabaallah, the name
of a place in Irāk, on the banks of the Euphrates, which is
also—and, perhaps, more correctly—called Karbalā. At this
place the army of Yuzeed, the King, was encamped; while the
band of Hussein, including himself, amounting only to seventy-two
persons, were on the other side of an intervening jungle,
called Mareea.</p>

<p>The Nawāb is a very public-spirited man, and does much
good; he took me over a school he founded, and supports, for
the education of native boys; showed me a very fine chīta
(hunting leopard), and some antelopes, which were kept for
fighting. For the public benefit, he has built a bridge, a ghāt,
and a sarā’e, a resting-place for travellers; all of which bear
his name.</p>

<p>The Begam, having been informed that I was with the Nawāb,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
sent to request I would pay a visit to the zenāna, and a day was
appointed in all due form.</p>

<p><i>May 3rd.</i>—The time having arrived, the Nawāb came to the
house at which I was staying, to pay me the compliment of
escorting me to visit the Begam. The Muharram having commenced,
all his family were therefore in mourning, and could
wear no jewels; he apologized that, in consequence, the Begam
could not be handsomely dressed to receive me. She is a pretty
looking woman, but has none of the style of James Gardner’s
Begam; she is evidently in great awe of the Hakīm, who rules,
I fancy, with a rod of iron. The rooms in the zenāna are long
and narrow, and supported by pillars on the side facing the
enclosed garden, where three fountains played very refreshingly,
in which golden fish were swimming. The Begam appeared
fond of the fish, and had some beautiful pigeons, which came to
be fed near the fountains; natives place a great value upon particular
breeds of pigeons, especially those obtained from Lucnow,
some of which bring a very high price. It is customary with
rich natives to keep a number of pigeons; the man in charge
of them makes them manœuvre in the air by word of command,
or rather by the motions of a long wand which he carries
in his hand, and with which he directs the flight of his pigeons;
making them wheel and circle in the air, and ascend or descend
at pleasure. The sets of pigeons consist of fifty, or of hundreds;
and to fly your own in mock battle against the pigeons of another
person is an amusement prized by the natives.</p>

<p>Several large glass cases were filled in the same curious manner
as those before mentioned; and the upper panes of the windows
were covered with English prints, some coloured and some
plain. The Hakīm asked me if I did not admire them? There
was Lord Brougham; also a number of prints of half-naked
boxers sparring; Molineux and Tom Cribb, &amp;c., in most
scientific attitudes; divers characters of hunting celebrity;
members of Parliament in profusion; and bright red and blue
pictures of females, as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter:—a
most uncouth collection to be displayed around the walls of a
zenāna! I was surprised to see pictures in the house of a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
considered to be so religious as the Nawāb; because the Prophet
said, “Every painter is in hell-fire, and God will appoint a person
at the day of resurrection, for every picture he shall have drawn,
to punish him in hell. Then, if you must make pictures, make
them of trees, and things without souls.” “And whoever draws
a picture will be punished, by ordering him to blow a spirit into
it; and this he can never do; and so he will be punished as
long as God wills.”</p>

<p>“The angels do not enter the house in which is a dog, nor
into that in which are pictures.”</p>

<p>I spent an hour in the zenāna, talking to the old Nawāb; the
Begam scarcely ventured to speak. He took me over her flower
garden, and made me promise I would never pass Fathīghar
without paying him a visit. I told him that when the rains
arrived, I should come up in the pinnace, having promised to
revisit my relatives, when I should have the pleasure of seeing
him and the Begam again. He pressed me to stay and see the
ceremonies of the Muharram; I regretted extremely I was
obliged to return home, being very anxious to see the mourning
festival celebrated in all state.</p>

<p>I happened to wear a ferronnière on my forehead; it amused
the Begam very much, because it somewhat resembled the tīka
worn by the women of the East.</p>

<p>His first Begam, to whom he was much attached, died: he
sent her body to Mekka: it went down at sea. This was
reckoned a great misfortune, and an omen of ill luck. Four
years afterwards he married the present Begam, who was slave
girl to the former.</p>

<p>Between the pauses in conversation the Nawāb would frequently
have recourse to his rosary, repeating, I suppose, the
ninety-nine names of God, and meditating on the attributes of
each. In the Qanoon-e-islam it is mentioned, “To read with
the use of a tusbeeh (or rosary) is meritorious; but it is an
innovation, since it was not enjoined by the prophet (the blessing
and peace of God be with him!) or his companions, but
established by certain mushaeks (or divines). They use the
chaplet in repeating the kulma (confession of faith) or durood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
(blessing), one, two, or more hundred times.” On the termination
of my visit to the zenāna, the Nawāb re-escorted me
to the house of the friend with whom I was staying.</p>

<p>For the first time, I saw to-day a person in a burkā walking
in the street; it was impossible to tell whether the figure was
male or female; the long swaggering strut made me suppose
the former. A pointed crown was on the top of the head, from
which ample folds of white linen fell to the feet, entirely concealing
the person. Before the eyes were two holes, into which
white net was inserted; therefore the person within could see
distinctly, while even the colour of the eyes was not discernible
from without. The burka’-posh, or person in the burka’,
entered the house of the Nawāb. The dress afterwards was sent
me to look at, and a copy of it was taken for me by my darzī
(tailor). It is often worn by respectable women, who cannot
afford to go out in a palanquin, or in a dolī.</p>

<p>The Hakīm was fond of writing notes in English, some of
which were curious. When the office of Commissioner was
done away with, he thought the gentleman who held the
appointment would be forced to quit Fathīghar. The old
Hakīm wrote a singular note, in which was this sentence: “As
for the man who formed the idea of doing away with your
appointment, my dear friend, may God blast him under the
earth.” However, as the gentleman remained at Fathīghar,
and the Government bestowed an appointment equally good upon
him, the Hakīm was satisfied. On my return to Allahabad,
he wrote to me, and desired me “not to bury his friendship and
affection in oblivion.”</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Paid a farewell visit to her Highness the ex-Queen of
Gwalior, in the Mahratta Camp, and quitted Fathīghar dāk for
Allahabad. A brain fever would have been the consequence,
had I not taken shelter during the day, as the hot winds were
blowing, and the weather intensely oppressive; therefore I only
travelled by night, and took refuge during the day.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—I stopped during the day at the house of a gentleman at
Menhdī Ghāt, which was built by the Nawāb, as well as the sarā’e
at Naramhow, which also bears his name. From this place I sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
to Kannouj for a quantity of chūrīs, <i>i.e.</i>, rings made of sealing-wax,
very prettily ornamented with gold foil, beads, and colours:
the old woman, who brought a large basketful for sale, put a
<i>very expensive</i> set on my arms; they cost four ānās, or three
pence! The price of a very pretty set is two ānās. My host
appeared surprised; he must have thought me a Pakka Hindostanī.
Kannouj is famed for the manufacture of chūrīs. I
wore the bracelets for two days, and then broke them off,
because the sealing-wax produced a most annoying irritation of
the skin.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—I spent the heat of the day with some kind friends at
Cawnpore, and the next dāk brought me to Fathīpoor. The day
after, I spent the sultry hours in the dāk bungalow, at Shāhzadpoor;
and the following morning was very glad to find myself
at home, after my long wanderings. The heat at times in the
pālkee was perfectly sickening. I had a small thermometer
with me, which, at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, often stood at 93°; and the sides of
the palanquin were hot as the sides of an oven. The fatigue
also of travelling so many nights was very great; but it did me
no harm.</p>

<p>I found Allahabad greatly altered; formerly it was a quiet
station, it had now become the seat of the Agra Government,
and Mr. Blunt, the Lieut.-Governor, was residing there. I had
often heard Colonel Gardner speak in high praise of this gentleman,
who was a friend of his. My time was now employed
in making and receiving visits, and going to parties.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—At the house of Mr. F⸺ I met the Austrian traveller,
Baron H⸺; he requested to be allowed to call on me
the next day to see my collection of curiosities. He pronounced
them very good, and promised to send me some idols
to add to them. I gave him a set of Hindoo toe-rings, the
sacred thread of the Brahmans, and a rosary, every bead of
which was carved with the name of the god Rām. Men were
deceivers ever; the promised idols were never added to my
collection. The Lieut.-Governor’s parties, which were very
agreeable, rendered Allahabad a very pleasant station.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 2nd.</i>—I went to the melā (fair) held within the grounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
at Papamhow. To this place we had sent the pinnace, the
Seagull; and on the 10th of the month my husband accompanied
me two days’ sail on my voyage, to revisit my relations
at Fathīghar, after which, he returned to Allahabad, leaving me
and the great spaniel Nero to proceed together. The daily
occurrences of this voyage may be omitted, only recording any
adventure that occurred during the course of it. The stream
is so excessively powerful, that at times, even with a fine strong
breeze and thirteen men on the towing-line, we are forced to
quit the main stream, and proceed up some smaller branch,
which occasions delay.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 14th.</i>—Arrived at Kurrah, a celebrated place in former
days, I wished to go on shore to see the tomb of Shaikh Karrick,
and to have a canter on the black pony, who was to meet me
there; but was obliged to give up the idea, because we were
compelled to go up the other side of the river in consequence
of the violence and rapidity of the stream.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, Alla, the son of Feroze, the second King of
Delhi, was Governor of Kurrah and Subadar of Oude. Alla
made an expedition into the Deccan, and returned laden with
spoil. Six hundred mŭn of pure gold; seven mŭn of pearls;
two mŭn of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires; one
thousand mŭn of silver, and four thousand pieces of silk, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The King of Delhi, wishing to share in his nephew’s plunder,
came down to Kurrah. Alla met him when his boat touched
the bank of the river; and, after the fondest greetings, made a
sign to two men, who came forward and murdered the king on
the spot.</p>

<p>They relate, that when Alla visited a celebrated sage, Shaikh
Karrick, who is buried at Kurrah, and whose tomb is held
sacred to this day, he rose from his pillow, and repeated an
extempore verse to the following purport:—“He cometh, but
his head shall fall in the boat, and his body in the Ganges,”
which, they say, was explained an hour afterwards by the death
of the King Feroze, whose head was thrown into the boat on
that occasion. One of the assassins died of a horrible leprosy,
which dissolved the flesh piecemeal from his bones; the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
went mad, and incessantly cried out that Feroze was cutting off
his head.</p>

<p>This detestable Alla seized the throne of Delhi, and reigned
under the title of Alla the First. He proposed, like Alexander
the Great, to undertake the conquest of the world. In consequence
of this project, he assumed the title of Sekunder al Sānī
(Alexander the Second), which was struck upon the currency of
the empire. The silver coins represented in the sketch (Fig. 6.)
which I procured at Fathīpoor, were found in a field five miles
from Kurrah; they were inscribed <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1313, Sekunder al Sānī.
Never was there such a wretch as this Alla the First. He
died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1316. I consider the coins as great a curiosity as the
gentleman considers one of <i>Thurtell’s ears</i>, which he has preserved
in spirits!</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—Anchored at Maigong in rather a picturesque spot,
close to a satī mound. By the side of the mound I saw the
trunk of a female figure beautifully carved in stone. The head,
arms, and part of the legs had been broken off. They said it
was the figure of a satī. At the back of the mound was a very
ancient banyan-tree; and the green hills and trees around were
in all the freshness and luxuriance of the rainy season.</p>

<p>The next morning, to my surprise, on going into the large
cabin to breakfast, there was the figure of the headless satī
covered with flowers, and at the spot where feet <i>were not</i>, offerings
of gram, boiled rice, &amp;c., had been placed by some of the
Hindoo dāndees. “How came you possessed of the satī?” said
I. “The mem sāhiba admired her, she is here.” “Chorī-ke-mal
nā’īch hazm hota,” “Stolen food never digests,” <i>i.e.</i>, “Ill
deeds never prosper, the poor people will grieve for the figure;
tell the sarang to lower sail and return her to them.” “What
words are these?” replied the sarang, “we are miles from the
spot; the satī has raised the wind.” The headless lady remained
on board.</p>

<p>As we passed the residence of Rājā Budannath Singh, he
came out with his family on three elephants to pay his respects,
thinking my husband was on board. The ladies were peeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
from the house-top. The pinnace passed in full sail, followed
by ten immense country boats full of magazine stores, and the
cook boat. Being unable at night to cross those rivers, we
anchored on the Oude side. I did not much admire being in
the domains of the King of Lucnow instead of those of the
Company; they are a very turbulent set, those men of Oude,
and often pillage boats. The vicinity of the Rājā’s house was
some protection. Rām Din had the matchlocks of the sipahī
guard fired off by way of bravado, and to show we were armed;
the lathīs (bamboos) were laid in readiness, in case of attack:
the watch was set, and, after these precautions, the mem sāhiba
and her dog went to rest very composedly.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Not a breath of air! a sun intensely hot; the river is
like a silver lake; but over its calm the vessel does <i>not</i> glide,
for we are fast on a sandbank! Down come the fiery beams;
several of the servants are ill of fever. Heaven help them; I
doctor them all, and have killed no one as yet! My husband will
fret himself as he sits in the coolness of the house and thinks of
me on the river. The vessel was in much difficulty this morning;
the conductor of some magazine boats sent forty men and
assisted her out of it. Lucky it was that chance meeting with
the conductor in this Wilderness of Waters! One is sure to
find some one to give aid in a difficulty, no doubt through the
power of the satī, whom they still continue to adorn with fresh
flowers.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—After a voyage of fifteen days and a half I arrived at
Cawnpore; coming up the reach of the Ganges, in front of
Cantonments, a powerful wind was in our favour. The Seagull
gallantly led the way in front of the twelve magazine
boats: a very pretty sight for the Cawnporeans, especially as a
squall overtook us, struck us all into picturesque attitudes, and
sunk one of the magazine boats, containing 16,000 rupees
worth of new matchlocks. When the squall struck the little
fleet, they were thrown one against another, the sails shivered,
and the centre boat sank like a stone. Being an eye-witness of
this scene, I was afterwards glad to be able to bear witness, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the request of the conductor, to his good conduct, and the care
he took of the boats, when called upon by the magistrate of the
place.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Anchored off Bittoor on the opposite side. I regretted
being unable to see the place and Bajee Row, the ex-Peshwā,
who resides there on an allowance of eight lākh per
annum. In 1818, he submitted to the Company, abdicated his
throne, and retired to Bittoor for life. It would have given
me pleasure to have seen these Mahrattas; but the channel of
the stream forced me to go up the other side of the river.</p>

<p>The Government wish the Bāiza Bā’ī to live at Benares on
six lākh a year; but the spirited old lady will not become a
pensioner, and refuses to quit Fathīghar. She has no inclination,
although an Hindoo, to be satisfied with “A little to eat
and to live at Bunarus<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>,” especially as at this place she is no
great distance from her beloved Gwalior.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 2nd.</i>—A day of adventures. Until noon, we battled
against wind and stream: then came a fair wind, which blew
in severe squalls and storms. Such a powerful stream against
us; but it was fine sailing, and I enjoyed it very much. At
times the squalls were enough to try one’s courage: We
passed a vessel that had just broken her mast: the stream
carried us back with violence, and we ran directly against her;
she crushed in one of the Venetian windows of the cabin, and
with that damage we escaped. Two men raising the sail of
another vessel were knocked overboard by the squall, and were
carried away with frightful velocity, the poor creatures calling
for help: the stream swept them past us, and threw them on
a sandbank—a happy escape!</p>

<p>Anchored at Menhdī ghāt; the moon was high and brilliant,
the wind roaring around us, the stream, also, roaring in concert,
like a distant waterfall; the night cold and clear, the stars
bright and fine; but the appearance of the sky foretold more
wind and squalls for the morrow. I had no idea, until I had
tried it, how much danger there was on the Gunga, during the
height of the rains; in this vessel I think myself safe, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
certainly I should not admire a small one. All the vessels
to-day were at anchor; not a sail was to be seen but the white
sails of the Seagull, and the dark ones of the cook boat, the latter
creeping along the shore, her mānjhī following very unwillingly.</p>

<p>My sarang says the quantity of sail I oblige him to carry
during high winds, has turned “his stomach upside down with
alarm.”</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—For some hours the next morning the gale continued so
violently, we could not quit the bank; a gentleman came on
board, and told me, by going up a stream, called the Kalī Nadī,
I should escape the very powerful rush of the Ganges; that I
could go up the Nadī twenty miles, and by a canal, cut in
former days, re-enter the Ganges above.</p>

<p>I asked him to show me the ruins of Kannouj; we put off;
it was blowing very hard: at last we got out safely into the
middle of the stream. About a mile higher up, we quitted the
roaring and rushing waters of the Ganges, and entered the placid
stream of the Kalī Nadī. Situated on a hill, most beautifully
wooded, with the winding river at its feet, stands the ancient
city of Kannouj; the stream flowing through fine green meadows
put me in mind of the Thames near Richmond. In the Ganges
we could scarcely stem the current, even though the wind,
which was fair, blew a gale; in the Nadī we furled every sail,
and were carried on at a good rate, merely by the force of the
wind on the hull of the vessel, and the non-opposition of the
gentle stream. My friend told me he had once thrown a net
across the Kalī Nadī, near the entrance, and had caught one
hundred and thirty-two great rhoee fish. On the hill above
stands the tomb of Colonel ⸺; who, when Lord Lake’s army
were encamped here on their road to Delhi, attempted on horseback
to swim the Nadī, and was drowned.</p>

<p>In the history of Kannouj, it is said, “Rustum Dista, King of
the Persian province of Seistan, conquered India; he, for his
great exploits, is styled the Hercules of the East; unwilling to
retain so distant an empire as a dependent on Persia, he placed
a new family on the throne. The name of the Prince raised to
the empire by Rustum was Suraja, who was a man of great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
abilities, and restored the power of the empire. This dynasty
commenced about 1072 years before the Christian æra, and it
lasted two hundred and eighty-six years. It is affirmed by the
Brahmins, that it was in the time of this dynasty that the
worship of emblematical figures of the Divine attributes was
first established in India.”</p>

<p>The Persians, in their invasions, they say, introduced the
worship of the sun, fire, and the heavenly bodies; but the
mental adoration of the Divinity, as the one Supreme Being, was
still followed by many.</p>

<p>The great city of Kannouj was built by one of the Surajas, on
the banks of the Ganges; the circumference of its walls is said
to have been nearly one hundred miles. It contained thirty
thousand shops, in which betel-nut was sold; and sixty thousand
bands of musicians and singers, who paid a tax to Government.
In <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1016, the King of Ghizni took Kannouj, “a city which,
in strength and structure, might justly boast to have no equal,
and which raised its head to the skies.” It is said, “The Hindostanee
language is more purely spoken in Kannouj than in
any other part of India.”</p>

<p>We anchored; and after tiffin, Mr. M⸺ accompanied me to
see the tombs of two Muhammadan saints, on the top of the
hill. Thence we visited a most singular Hindoo building, of great
antiquity, which still exists in a state of very tolerable preservation;
the style of the building, one stone placed on the top of
another, appeared to me more remarkable than any architecture
I had seen in India. A further account of this ancient building,
with a sketch annexed, will be given in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>The fort, which is in ruins, is on a commanding spot; the
view from it all around is beautiful. The people sometimes find
ancient coins amongst the ruins, and jewels of high value; a
short time ago, some pieces of gold, in form and size like thin
bricks, were discovered by an old woman; they were very
valuable. The Brahmans brought to us for sale, square rupees,
old rupees, and copper coins; but none of them were Hindoo;
those of copper, or of silver, not being more than three hundred
years old, were hardly worth having. I commissioned them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
bring me some gold coins, which are usually genuine and good.
A regular trade is carried on at this place in the fabrication of
silver and copper coins, and those of a mixed metal. The rose-water
of Kannouj is considered very fine; it was brought, with
other perfumed waters, for sale; also native preserves and
pickles, which were inferior. To this day the singers of Kannouj
are famous. I am glad I have seen the ruins of this old city,
which are well worth visiting; I did not go into the modern
town; the scenery is remarkably pretty. I must revisit this
place on my black horse; there are many parts too distant from
each other for a walk; I returned very much fatigued to the
pinnace. A great many Hindoo idols, carved in stone, were
scattered about in all directions, broken by the zeal of the
Muhammadans, when they became possessed of Kannouj. I
shall carry some off should I return this way.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—A hot day, without a breath of air, was followed by as
hot a night, during which I could not close my eyes; and a
cough tore my chest to pieces.</p>

<p>When we lugāoed, I saw two fires by the side of the stream;
from one of which they took up a half-burned body, and flung
it into the river. The other fire was burning brightly, and a
Hindoo, with a long pole, was stirring it up, and pushing the
corpse of his father, or whoever the relation was, properly into
the flames, that it might all consume. The nearest relation
always performs this ceremony. The evening had gathered in
darkly; some fifteen black figures were between us and the
sunset, standing around the fire; the palm-trees, and some huts,
all reflected in the quiet stream of the Kalī Nadī, had a good
effect; especially when the man with the long pole stirred up
his bāp (father), and the flames glowed the brighter.</p>

<p>I was glad to get away, and anchor further on, the smell on
such occasions being objectionable; it is a horrible custom, this
burning the corpse; the poor must always do it by halves, it
takes so much wood to consume the body to ashes.</p>

<p>The sirdar-bearer of an officer died; the gentleman desired
a small present might be given to his widow, in aid of the
funeral. At the end of the month, when the officer’s accounts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
were brought to him for settlement, he found the following item,
“For roasting sirdar-bearer, five rupees!”</p>

<p>Some Hindoos do not burn their dead; I saw a body brought
down to the river-side this evening, by some respectable-looking
people; they pushed the corpse into the stream, and splashed
handfuls of water after it, uttering some prayer.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—After fighting with the stream all day, and tiring the
crew to death on sandbanks, and pulling against a terribly
powerful current, we were forced back to within two miles of our
last night’s anchorage; we have happily found a safe place to
remain in during the night; these high banks, which are continually
falling in, are very dangerous. Fortunately in the
evening, assisted by a breeze, we arrived at the canal; and
having passed through it quitted the Kalī Nadī, and anchored
in the deep old bed of the Ganges.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—With great difficulty we succeeded in bringing the
pinnace to within three miles of Fathīghar, where I found a
palanquin in waiting for me; the river being very shallow, I
quitted the vessel, and, on my arrival at my friend’s house, sent
down a number of men to assist in bringing her up in
safety.</p>

</div>

<p>1835, <i>Sept. 8th.</i>—A deputation arrived from her Highness the
Bāiza Bā’ī, claiming protection from the Agent to the Government,
on account of a mutiny in her camp. She was fearful of
being murdered, as her house was surrounded by three hundred
and fifty mutinous soldiers, armed with matchlocks and their
palitas ready lighted. The mutineers demanded seven months
pay; and finding it was not in her power to give it to them,
they determined to have recourse to force, and seized her
treasurer, her paymaster, and four other officers. These unfortunate
men they had made prisoners for seven days, keeping
them secured to posts and exposed the whole day to the sun,
and only giving them a little sherbet to drink. The Agent to the
Government having called out the troops, marched down with
them to the Mahratta Camp, where they seized the guns.</p>

<p>The mutineers would not come to terms, or lay down their
arms. The troops spent the night in the Camp; at daybreak
they charged into the zenāna compound, killed eight mutineers,
and wounded nine: the guns were fired at the Mahratta horsemen,
who were outside; after which the men laid down their
arms, and tranquillity was restored.</p>

<p>The magistrate of the station, who had gone in with the troops,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
was engaged with two of the mutineers, when all three fell into a
well; a Mahratta from above having aimed his spear at him, an
officer struck the weapon aside and killed the assailant; the spear
glanced off and only inflicted a slight wound. The moment
Colonel J⸺ charged the mutineers in the zenāna compound,
they murdered their prisoners, the treasurer and the paymaster,
in cold blood; the other four officers escaped in the tumult. The
greater part of her Highness’s troops being disaffected, they could
not be trusted to quell the mutiny; she was therefore compelled
to ask for assistance. It was feared her troops, which amounted
to eighteen hundred, might attempt to plunder the city and
station, and be off to Gwalior; and there being only two hundred
of the Company’s troops, and three guns at Fathīghar, the
military were sent for from other stations, and a large body
of police called out. The Bāiza Bā’ī despatched a lady several
times to say she wished me to visit her; this was during the
time she was a prisoner in her house, surrounded by the mutineers
with their matches lighted. The agent for the Government
would not allow me to go, lest they should seize and keep
me a prisoner with the Bā’ī’s officers. I was therefore obliged
to send word I could not obey the commands of her Highness
on that account.</p>

<p>Emissaries from Gwalior are at the bottom of all this. The
camp was in great ferment yesterday: it would be of no consequence,
if we had a few more troops at the station; but two
hundred infantry are sad odds against eighteen hundred men, one
thousand of whom are horsemen; and they have three guns also.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Infantry have come in from Mynpooree and cavalry
from Cawnpore, therefore every thing is safe in case the Mahrattas
should mutiny again.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—The Governor-General’s agent allowed me to accompany
him to the camp. He took some armed horsemen
from the police as an escort in case of disturbance. The Bāiza
Bā’ī received me most kindly, as if I were an old friend. I paid
my respects, and almost immediately quitted the room, as affairs
of state were to be discussed. The Gaja Rājā took me into a
pretty little room, which she had just built on the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
house as a sleeping-room for herself. Her charpāī (bed) swung
from the ceiling; the feet were of gold, and the ropes by which
it swung were covered with red velvet and silver bands. The
mattress, stuffed with cotton, was covered with red and blue
velvet: the cases of three large pillows were of gold and red
kimkhwab; and there were a number of small flat round pillows
covered with velvet. The counterpane was of gold and red
brocade. In this bed she sleeps, and is constantly swung during
her repose. She was dressed in black gauze and gold, with a profusion
of jewellery, and some fresh flowers I had brought for her
were in her hair. She invited me to sit on the bed, and a lady
stood by swinging us. The Gaja Rājā has a very pretty figure,
and looked most fairy-like on her decorated bed. When the affairs
of state had been settled, we returned to the Bā’ī. Rose-water,
pān, and atr of roses having been presented, I took my leave.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—I was one of a party who paid a visit of state to
her Highness. Nothing remarkable occurred. As we were on
the point of taking our departure, the Bā’ī said she had heard
of the beauty of my pinnace, and would visit it the next
morning. This being a great honour, I said I would be in
attendance, and would have the vessel anchored close to the
Bā’ī’s own ghāt, at which place she bathes in the holy Ganges.
On my return home, a number of people were set hard to work,
to fit the vessel for the reception of the Bā’ī. Every thing European
was removed, tables, chairs, &amp;c. The floors of the cabins
were covered with white cloth, and a gaddī placed in each for
her Highness.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—The vessel was decorated with a profusion of fresh
flowers; she was drawn up to the ghāt, close to a flight of
steps; and the canvas walls of tents were hung around her on
every side, so that no spectators could see within. The sailors
all quitted her, and she was then ready to receive the ladies of
the Mahratta camp. Although I was at the spot at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the
Bā’ī and hundreds of her followers were there before me. She
accompanied me on board with all her ladies, and on seeing
such a crowd in the vessel, asked if the numbers would not
sink her. The Bā’ī admired the pinnace very much; and observing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the satī, which stood in one corner of the cabin, covered
with flowers, I informed her Highness I had brought the headless
figure to <i>eat the air</i> on the river; that Ganges water and
flowers were daily offered her; that her presence was fortunate, as
it brought an easterly wind. The Bā’ī laughed; and, after conversing
for an hour, she quitted the vessel, and returned to her
apartment on the ghāt. The Gaja Rājā and her ladies went
into the inner cabin; Appa Sāhib, the Bā’ī’s son-in-law, came
on board with his followers, the vessel was unmoored, and they
took a sail on the river. The scene was picturesque. Some
hundreds of Mahratta soldiers were dispersed in groups on the
high banks amongst the trees; their elephants, camels, horses,
and native carriages standing near the stone ghāts, and by the
side of white temples. The people from the city were there in
crowds to see what was going forward. On our return from the
excursion on the river, I accompanied the Gaja Rājā to the
Bā’ī; and, having made my salām, returned home, not a little
fatigued with the exertion of amusing my guests. During the
time we were on the water, Appa Sāhib played various Hindostanee
and Mahratta airs on the sitar. It must have been a
great amusement to the zenāna ladies, quite a gaiety for them,
and a variety in their retired mode of life. They were all in
their holiday dresses, jewels, and ornaments. Some wore
dresses of bright yellow, edged with red, with black Cashmere
shawls thrown over their shoulders; this costume was very
picturesque. The Gaja Rājā wore a dress of black and gold,
with a yellow satin tight body beneath it; <i>enormous</i> pearls in
profusion, ornaments of gold on her arms, and silver ornaments
on her ankles and toes; slippers of crimson and gold.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 2nd.</i>—The Ganges at Farrukhabad is so full of sandbanks,
and so very shallow, that fearing if I detained the
pinnace, I might have some chance of being unable to get her
down to Cawnpore, I sent her off with half the servants to that
place to await my arrival; I shall go dāk in a palanquin, and
the rest of the people can float down in the cook boat.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—I called on the Bā’ī; and while she was employed on
state affairs, retired with the Gaja Rājā to the pretty little room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
before mentioned. There I found a Hindoo idol, dressed in
cloth of gold, and beads, lying on the floor on a little red and
purple velvet carpet. Two other idols were in niches at the end
of the room. The idol appeared to be a plaything, a doll: I
suppose, it had not been rendered sacred by the Brahmans. An
idol is of no value until a Brahman dip it, with divers prayers
and ceremonies, into the Gunga; when this ceremony has been
performed, the spirit of the particular deity represented by the
figure enters the idol. This sort of baptism is particularly
expensive, and a source of great revenue to the Brahmans. The
church dues fall as heavily on the poor Hindoo, as on the people
of England; nevertheless, the heads of the Hindoo church do
not live in luxury like the Bishops.</p>

<p>The fakīr, who from a religious motive, however mistaken,
holds up both arms, until they become withered and immovable,
and who, being, in consequence, utterly unable to support
himself, relies in perfect faith on the support of the Almighty,
displays more religion than the man, who, with a salary
of £8000 per annum, leaves the work to be done by curates,
on a pittance of £80 a year.</p>

<p>The Gaja Rājā requested me to teach her how to make tea,
she having been advised to drink it for her health; she retired,
changed her dress, returned, took her tea, and complained of its
bitter taste.</p>

<p>“I am told you dress a camel beautifully,” said the young
Princess; “and I was anxious to see you this morning, to ask
you to instruct my people how to attire a sawārī camel.”
This was flattering me on a very weak point: there is but one
thing in the world that I <i>perfectly</i> understand, and that is, how
to dress a camel.</p>

<p>“I hope you do not eat him when you have dressed him!”
said an English gentleman.</p>

<p>My relative had a fine young camel, and I was not happy
until I had superintended the making the attire, in which he—the
camel, not the gentleman—looked beautiful! The Nawāb
Hakīm Menhdī, having seen the animal, called, to request he
might have similar trappings for his own sawārī camel; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the fame thereof having reached the Mahratta camp, my talents
were called into play. I promised to attend to the wishes of
the Gaja Rājā; and, returning home, summoned twelve mochīs,
the saddlers of India, natives of the Chamār caste, to perform
the work. Whilst one of the men smokes the nārjīl (cocoa-nut
pipe), the remainder will work; but it is absolutely necessary that
each should have his turn every half-hour, no smoke,—no work.</p>

<p>Five hundred small brass bells of melodious sound; two
hundred larger ditto, in harmony, like hounds well matched,
each under each; and one large bell, to crown the whole; one
hundred large beads of imitative turquoise; two snow-white
tails of the cow of Thibet; some thousands of cowries, many
yards of black and of crimson cloth, and a number of very long
tassels of red and black worsted. The mochīs embroidered
the attire for three days, and it was remarkably handsome. The
camel’s clothing being ready, it was put into a box, and the
Gaja Rājā having appointed an hour, I rode over, taking it with
me, at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>In the court-yard of the zenāna, I found the Bā’ī, and all
her ladies; she asked me to canter round the enclosure, the
absurdity of sitting on one side a horse being still an amusing
novelty.</p>

<p>The Bā’ī’s riding horses were brought out; she was a great
equestrian in her youthful days, and, although she has now given
up the exercise, delights in horses. The ladies relate, with great
pride, that, in one battle, her Highness rode at the head of her
troops, with a lance in her hand, and her infant in her arms!</p>

<p>A very vicious, but large and handsome camel was then
brought in by the female attendants; he knelt down, and they
began putting the gay trappings upon him; his nose was tied to
his knee, to prevent his injuring the girls around him, whom he
attempted to catch hold of, showing his great white teeth; if
once the jaw of a camel closes upon you, he will not relinquish
his hold. You would have supposed they were murdering, not
dressing the animal; he groaned and shouted as if in great pain,
it was piteous to hear the beast; and laughable, when you
remembered it was the “dastūr;” they always groan and moan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
when any load is placed on their backs, however light. When
the camel’s toilet was completed, a Mahratta girl jumped on his
back, and made him go round the enclosure at a capital rate;
the trappings were admired, and the bells pronounced very
musical.</p>

<p>They were eager I should mount the camel; I thought of
Theodore Hook. “The hostess said, ‘Mr. Hook, will you
venture upon an orange?’ ‘No, thank you, Ma’am, I’m afraid
I should tumble off.’” <i>C’est beau çà, n’est pas?</i> I declined the
elevated position offered me, for the same reason.</p>

<p>The finest young sawārī camels, that have never been debased
by carrying any burthen greater than two or three Persian
cats, are brought down in droves by the Arabs from Cabul;
one man has usually charge of three camels; they travel in
single file, the nose of one being attached to the crupper of
another by a string passed through the cartilage. They browse
on leaves in preference to grazing. It was a picturesque scene,
that toilet of the camel, performed by the Mahratta girls, and
they enjoyed the tamāshā.</p>

<p>I mentioned my departure was near at hand; the Bā’ī spoke
of her beloved Gwalior, and did me the honour to invite me to
pay my respects there, should she ever be replaced on the gaddī.
She desired I would pay a farewell visit to the camp three days
afterwards. After the distribution, as usual, of betel leaves,
spices, atr of roses, and the sprinkling with rose-water, I made
my salām. Were I an Asiatic, I would be a Mahratta.</p>

<p>The Mahrattas never transact business on an unlucky day;
Tuesday is an unfortunate day, and the Bā’ī, who was to have
held a durbār, put it off in consequence. She sent for me, it
being the day I was to take leave of her; I found her looking
grave and thoughtful, and her sweet smile was very sad. She
told me the Court of Directors had sent orders that she was to
go and live at Benares, or in the Deccan; that she was to quit
Fathīghar in one month’s time, and should she refuse to do so,
the Governor-General’s agent was to take her to Benares by
force, under escort of troops that had been sent to Fathīghar for
that purpose. The Bā’ī was greatly distressed, but spoke on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
subject with a command of temper, and a dignity that I greatly
admired. “What must the Mahāraj do? Cannot this evil fate be
averted? Must she go to Benares? Tell us, Mem sāhiba, what
must we do?” said one of the ladies in attendance. Thus
called upon, I was obliged to give my opinion; it was an awkward
thing to tell an exiled Queen she must submit,—“The cudgel
of the powerful must be obeyed<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.” I hesitated; the Bā’ī
looked at me for an answer. Dropping the eyes of perplexity
on the folded hands of despondency, I replied to the Brija, who
had asked the question, “Jiska lāthī ooska bhains,”—<i>i.e.</i> “He
who has the stick, his is the buffalo<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>!” The effect was electric.
The Bāiza Bā’ī and the Gaja Rājā laughed, and I believe the
odd and absurd application of the proverb half reconciled the
Mahāraj to her fate.</p>

<p>I remained with her Highness some time, talking over the
severity of the orders of Government, and took leave of her with
great sorrow; the time I had before spent in the camp had been
days of amusement and gaiety; the last day, the unlucky
Tuesday, was indeed ill-starred, and full of misery to the unfortunate
and amiable ex-Queen of Gwalior.</p>

<p>1835, <i>Oct.</i>—One day I called on the Begam, the mother of the
young Nawāb of Farrukhabad, and found her with all her relations
sitting in the garden; they were plainly dressed, and looked
very ugly. For a woman not to be pretty when she is shut up
in a zenāna appears almost a sin, so much are we ruled in our
ideas by what we read in childhood of the hoorīs of the East.</p>

<p>One morning, the Nawāb Hakīm Menhdī called; his dress
was most curious; half European, half Asiatic. The day being
cold, he wore brown corduroy breeches, with black leather boots,
and thick leather gloves; over this attire was a dress of fine
white flowered Dacca muslin; and again, over that, a dress of
pale pink satin, embroidered in gold! His turban was of gold
and red Benares tissue. He carried his sword in his hand, and an
attendant followed, bearing his hooqŭ; he was in high spirits,
very agreeable, and I was quite sorry when he rose to depart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
In the evening, he sent down a charming little elephant, only
five years old, for me to ride; which I amused myself with doing
in the beautiful grounds around the house, sitting on the back
of the little beauty, and guiding him with cords passed through
his ears.</p>

<p>The next evening the Nawāb sent his largest elephant, on
which was an amārī,—that is, a howdah, with a canopy,—which,
according to native fashion, was richly gilt, the interior
lined with velvet, and velvet cushions; the elephant was a fast
one, his paces very easy, and I took a long ride in the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>The Muhammadans have a fondness for archery, for which the
following extract accounts:—“There was an Arabian bow in
the hand of the Prophet, and he saw a man with a Persian one,
and said, ‘Throw away the Persian bow, and adopt the Arabian,
and appropriate arrows and spears; because God verily will
assist with them in religion, and will make you conquerors of
cities.’” “Verily, God brings three persons into Paradise, on
account of one arrow; the first, the maker of it, being for war;
the second, the shooter of it in the road of God; the third, the
giver of the arrow into the hands of the archer.”</p>

<p>“His Highness entered Mecca on the day of taking it with
his sword ornamented with gold and silver; and he had two
coats of mail on the day of the battle of Oh’ud, and wore one
over the other; the Prophet had two standards, one large, the
other small; the large one was black, and the small one white;
verily, the Prophet came into Mecca with a white ensign.”</p>

<p>We were speaking to-day of the practice of burying money,
so much resorted to by the natives, when a gentleman remarked,—“It
is a curious circumstance, that when a native buries
treasure, in order to secure it, the only persons who know the
secret are a low, debased caste, called Chamārs; these men are
faithful to their employer; they will bury lākhs of rupees, and
never betray the spot; they dig the ground, and guard it; as
long as their employer lives they keep the secret; the moment
of his death, they dig up, and are off with the money; they
consider they have a right to it in that case, and they would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
give it up to his son.” This is a curious fact, and accounts
for their strict secrecy during the life of the owner.</p>

<p>Buried treasures, consisting of jewels, as well as the precious
metals, to the extent of lākhs and lākhs, are supposed to exist
in the East; the inhabitants in ancient, and even in modern
times, being in the habit of thus securing their property from
plunder in wars and invasions; but they have not sufficient faith
in their Mother Earth to leave their valuables in her care without
the aid of necromancy (jādū); and, as before mentioned, the
Akbarābādee, or square gold mohur, as represented by Fig. 7 in
the plate entitled “<a href="#plate30">Superstitions of the Natives</a>,” is had recourse
to, and buried with the treasure. Those who are not fortunate
enough to possess a square gold mohur, substitute an Akbarābādee
rupee, Fig. 5; or a square eight ānā piece, Fig. 4. It is
also stated that an animal, sometimes a man, is killed, and
buried with it as a guard; this animal is called <i>jak</i>, and receives
orders to allow no one else to take up the treasure. It is not
surprising the natives should behold the researches of English
antiquaries with a jealous eye; and it must be some consolation
to them that they believe a fatality awaits the appropriation, by
the discoverer, of a hidden treasure.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—Having despatched the pinnace to await my arrival at
Cawnpore, I started dāk for that place, which I reached the next
day, after a most disagreeable journey; I was also suffering from
illness, but the care of my kind friends soon restored me to
more comfortable feelings.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—I accompanied them to dine with the Nawāb Zulfecar
Bahādur, of Banda. The Nawāb is a Muhammadan, but he is of
a Mahratta family, formerly Hindoos; when he changed his
religion, and became one of the faithful, I know not. Three of
his children came in to see the company; the two girls are very
interesting little creatures. The Nawāb sat at table, partook of
native dishes, and drank sherbet when his guests took wine.
The next day, the Nawāb dined with the gentleman at whose
house I was staying, and met a large party.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—I quitted Cawnpore in the Seagull, and once more
found myself on the waters of the Gunga: a comet was plainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
visible through a glass; its hazy aspect rendered it a malignant-looking
star. The solitude of my boat is very agreeable after so
much exertion.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Anchored off a ship-builder’s yard, and purchased
six great trees; sal, shorea robusta, and teak (tectona grandis);
what they may turn out I can scarcely tell; I bought them by
torch-light, had them pitched into the river, and secured to the
boats; the teak trees to make into tables and chairs; the sal
for a thermantidote; we have one at home, but having seen one
very superior at Fathīghar, induced me to have the iron-work
made at that place; I have brought it down upon the boats, and
have now purchased the wood for it, <i>en route</i>, timber being
reasonable at Cawnpore.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Here are we,—that is, the dog Nero and the Mem
sāhiba,—floating so calmly, and yet so rapidly, down the river;
it is most agreeable; the temples and ghāts we are now passing
at Dalmhow are beautiful; how picturesque are the banks of an
Indian river! the flights of stone steps which descend into the
water; the temples around them of such peculiar Hindoo architecture;
the natives, both men and women, bathing or filling
their jars with the water of the holy Gunga; the fine trees, and
the brightness of the sunshine, add great beauty to the scene.
One great defect is the colour of the stream, which, during the
rains, is peculiarly muddy; you have no bright reflections on
the Ganges, they fall heavy and indistinct.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Lugāoed the pinnace in the Jumna, beneath the great
peepul in our garden, on the banks of the river.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Dined with Mr. Blunt, the Lieutenant-Governor; and
the next day a lancet was put into my arm, to relieve an intolerable
pain in my head, brought on by exposure to the sun on the
river.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 6th.</i>—The Lieutenant-Governor gave a farewell ball to
the Station, on resigning the appointment to Mr. Ross. The
news arrived that her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī, having been
forced to quit Fathīghar, by order of the Government, is on her
march down to Benares; at which place they wish her to reside.
Una Bā’ī, one of her ladies, having preceded her to Allahabad,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
called on me, and begged me to take her on board the Calcutta
steam-vessel, an object of great surprise to the natives.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—The gentlemen of the Civil Service, and the military at
the Station, gave a farewell ball to the Lieutenant-Governor; I
was ill, and unable to attend. Oh! the pain of rheumatic fever!
The new Lieutenant-Governor arrived; he gave a few dinners,
and received them in return; after which Allahabad subsided
into its usual quietude, enlivened now and then by a Bachelor’s
Ball.</p>

<p>1836, <i>Jan. 16th.</i>—The Bāiza Bā’ī arrived at Allahabad, and
encamped about seven miles from our house, on the banks of
the Jumna, beyond the city. A few days after, the Brija Bā’ī,
one of her ladies, came to me, to say her Highness wished to
see me; accordingly I went to her encampment. She was out
of spirits, very unhappy and uncomfortable, but expressed much
pleasure at my arrival.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 5th.</i>—Her Highness requested the steam-vessel should
be sent up the river, opposite her tents; she went on board, and
was much pleased, asked a great many questions respecting the
steam and machinery, and went a short distance up the river.
Capt. Ross accompanied her Highness to Allahabad, and remained
there in charge of her, whilst her fate was being decided by the
Government.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—The Bā’ī gave a dinner party at her tents to twenty of
the civilians and the military; in the evening there was a nāch,
and fireworks were displayed; the ex-Queen appeared much
pleased.</p>

<p>There is a very extensive enclosure at Allahabad, called Sultan
Khusrū’s garden; tents had been sent there, and pitched under
some magnificent tamarind trees, where a large party were assembled
at tiffin, when the Bā’ī sent down a Mahratta dinner, to
add to the entertainment. In the evening, her two rhinoceroses
arrived; they fought one another rather fiercely; it was
an amusement for the party. Captain Ross having quitted
Allahabad, Mr. Scott took charge of her Highness.</p>

<p><i>March 1st.</i>—The Brija Bā’ī called to request me to assist
them in giving a dinner party to the Station, for which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Bāiza Bā’ī wished to send out invitations; I was happy to aid her.
The guests arrived at about seven in the evening; the gentlemen
were received by Appa Sāhib, her son-in-law; the ladies were
ushered behind the parda, into the presence of her Highness.
I have never described the parda which protects the Mahratta
ladies from the gaze of the men: In the centre of a long room
a large curtain is dropped, not unlike the curtain at a theatre,
the space behind which is sacred to the women; and there
the gaddī of the Bā’ī was placed, close to the parda; a piece of
silver, about six inches square, in which a number of small holes
are pierced, is let into the parda; and this is covered on the
inside with white muslin. When the Bā’ī wished to see the
gentlemen, her guests, she raised the bit of white muslin, and
could then see every thing in the next room through the holes
in the silver plate—herself unseen. The gentlemen were in the
outer room, the ladies in the inner. Appa Sāhib sat close to
the parda; the Bā’ī conversed with him, and, through him, with
some of the gentlemen present, whom she could see perfectly
well.</p>

<p>Dancing girls sang and nāched before the gentlemen until
dinner was announced. Many ladies were behind the parda with
the Bāiza Bā’ī, and she asked me to interpret for those who
could not speak Urdu. I was suffering from severe rheumatic
pain in my face; her Highness perceiving it, took from a small
gold box a lump of opium, and desired me to eat it, saying, she
took as much herself every day. I requested a smaller portion;
she broke off about one-third of the lump, which I put into my
mouth, and as it dissolved the pain vanished; I became very
happy, interpreted for the ladies, felt no fatigue, and talked
incessantly. Returning home, being obliged to go across the
country for a mile in a palanquin, to reach the carriage, the dust
which rolled up most thickly half choked me; nevertheless, I
felt perfectly happy, nothing could discompose me; but the
next morning I was obliged to call in medical advice, on account
of the severe pain in my head, from the effect of the opium.</p>

<p>The table for dinner was laid in a most magnificent tent, lined
with crimson cloth, richly embossed, and lighted with numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
chandeliers. The nāch girls danced in the next apartment,
but within sight of the guests; her Highness and her grand-daughter,
from behind the parda, looked on. About two hundred
native dishes, in silver bowls, were handed round by Brahmans;
and it was considered etiquette to take a small portion from
each dish. On the conclusion of the repast, the Governor-General’s
agent rose, and drank her Highness’s health, <i>bowing
to the parda</i>; and Appa Sāhib returned thanks, in the name of
the Bā’ī. The dinner and the wines were excellent; the latter
admirably cooled. Fireworks were let off, and a salute was
fired from the cannon when the guests departed. Her nephew
was there in his wedding dress—cloth of gold most elaborately
worked. The Bā’ī expressed herself greatly pleased with the
party, and invited me to attend the wedding of her nephew the
next day, and to join her when she went in state to bathe in
the Jumna. I was very glad to see her pleased, and in good
spirits.</p>

<p><i>March 4th.</i>—This being the great day of the wedding, at the
invitation of the Bā’ī we took a large party to the camp to see
the ceremonies in the cool of the evening. Having made our
salām to her Highness, we proceeded with the Gaja Rājā Sāhib
to the tents of the bride, which were about half a mile from
those of the bridegroom. The ceremony was going on when we
entered. The bridegroom, dressed in all his heavy finery, stood
amongst the priests, who held a white sheet between him and
the bride, who stood on the other side, while they chanted
certain prayers. When the prayers were concluded, and a
quantity of some sort of small grain had been thrown at the
lady, the priest dropped the cloth, and the bridegroom beheld
his bride. She was dressed in Mahratta attire, over which was
a dopatta of crimson silk, worked in gold stars; this covered
her forehead and face entirely, and fell in folds to her feet.
Whether the person beneath this covering was man, woman, or
child, it was impossible to tell: bound round the forehead, outside
this golden veil, was a sihrā, a fillet of golden tissue, from
which strings and bands of gold and silver fell over her face.
The bridegroom must have taken upon trust, that the woman he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
wished to marry was the one concealed under these curious
wedding garments. It was late at night; we all returned to the
Bā’ī’s tent, and the ladies departed, all but Mrs. Colonel W⸺
and myself; the Gaja Rājā having asked us to stay and see the
finale of the marriage. The young Princess retired to bathe,
after which, having been attired in yellow silk, with a deep
gold border, and covered with jewels, she rejoined us, and we
set out to walk half a mile to the tents of the bride; this being
a part of the ceremony. The Gaja Rājā, her ladies, and
attendants, Mrs. W⸺, and myself, walked with her in parda;
that is, the canvas walls of tents having been fixed on long
poles so as to form an oblong inclosure, a great number of men
on the outside took up the poles and moved gently on; while
we who were inside, walked in procession over white cloths,
spread all the way from the tent of the Bā’ī to that of the bride.
It was past 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Fireworks were let off, and blue lights thrown
up from the outside, which lighting up the procession of beautifully
dressed Mahratta ladies, gave a most picturesque effect to
the scene. The graceful little Gaja Rājā, with her slight form
and brilliant attire, looked like what we picture to ourselves a
fairy was in the good old times, when such beings visited the
earth. At the head of this procession was a girl carrying a
torch; next to her a nāch girl danced and figured about; then
a girl in the dress of a soldier, who carried a musket and played
all sorts of pranks. Another carried a pole, on which were suspended
onions, old shoes, and all sorts of queer extraordinary
things to make the people laugh. Arrived at the end of our
march, the Gaja Rājā seated herself, and water was poured over
her beautiful little feet. We then entered the tent of the bride,
where many more ceremonies were performed. During the
walk in parda, I looked at Mrs. W⸺, who had accompanied
me, and could not help saying, “We flatter ourselves we are
well dressed, but in our hideous European ungraceful attire we
are a blot in the procession. I feel ashamed when the blue
lights bring me out of the shade; we destroy the beauty of the
scene.”</p>

<p>I requested permission to raise the veil and view the countenance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
of the bride. She is young, and, for a Mahratta,
handsome. The Bā’ī presented her with a necklace of pure
heavy red gold; and told me she was now so poor she was
unable to give her pearls and diamonds. New dresses were
then presented to all her ladies. We witnessed so many forms
and ceremonies, I cannot describe one-fourth of them. That night
the bridegroom took his bride to his own tents, but the ceremonies
of the wedding continued for many days afterwards. I
returned home very much pleased at having witnessed a shādī
among the Hindoos, having before seen the same ceremony
among the Muhammadans.</p>

<p>The ex-Queen had some tents pitched at that most sacred
spot, the Treveni, the junction of the three rivers; and to these
tents she came down continually to bathe; her ladies and a
large concourse of people were in attendance upon her, and
there they performed the rites and ceremonies. The superstitions
and the religion of the Hindoos were to me most interesting
subjects, and had been so ever since my arrival in the
country. Her Highness was acquainted with this, and kindly
asked me to visit her in the tents at the junction whenever any
remarkable ceremony was to be performed. This delighted me,
as it gave me an opportunity of seeing the worship, and conversing
on religious subjects with the ladies, as well as with the
Brahmans. The favourite attendant, the Brija Bā’ī never failed
to call, and invite me to join their party at the time of the celebration
of any particular rite. At one of the festivals her
Highness invited me to visit her tents at the Treveni. I found
the Mahratta ladies assembled there: the tents were pitched close
to the margin of the Ganges, and the canvas walls were run out
to a considerable distance into the river. Her Highness, in her
usual attire, waded into the stream, and shaded by the kanāts
from the gaze of men, reached the sacred junction, where she
performed her devotions, the water reaching to her waist.
After which she waded back again to the tents, changed her
attire, performed pooja, and gave magnificent presents to the
attendant Brahmans. The Gaja Rājā and all the Mahratta
ladies accompanied the ex-Queen to the sacred junction, as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
returned dripping from the river, their draperies of silk and
gold clung to their figures; and very beautiful was the statue-like
effect, as the attire half revealed and half concealed the
contour of the figure.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—The hot winds have set in very powerfully; to-day I
was sent for by the Bāiza Bā’ī, who is in tents; great sickness
is prevalent in the camp, and many are ill of cholera.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Sir Charles Metcalfe arrived to reside at Allahabad,
on his appointment to be Lieutenant-Governor of Agra. The
hot winds are blowing very strongly; therefore, with tattīs, the
house is cool and pleasant; while, out of doors, the heat is
excessive. Her Highness, having been unable to procure a
house, still remains encamped; the heat under canvas must be
dreadful.</p>

<p><i>May 1st.</i>—She sent for me, and I found the Gaja Rājā ill of
fever, and suffering greatly from the intense heat.</p>

<p><i>May 9th.</i>—Was the Sohobut Melā, or Fair of Kites, in
Alopee Bāgh; I went to see it; hundreds of people, in their
gayest dresses, were flying kites in all directions, so happily and
eagerly; and under the fine trees in the mango tope, sweetmeats,
toys, and children’s ornaments, were displayed in booths erected
for the purpose. It was a pretty sight, that Alopee ke Melā.</p>

<p>The kites are of different shapes, principally square, and
have no tails; the strings are covered with mānjhā, a paste
mixed with pounded glass, and applied to the string, to enable
it to cut that of another by friction. One man flies his kite
against another, and he is the loser whose string it cut. The
boys, and the men also, race after the defeated kite, which
becomes the prize of the person who first seizes it. It requires
some skill to gain the victory; the men are as fond of the sport
as the boys.</p>

<p>The string of a kite caught tightly round the tail of my horse
Trelawny, and threatened to carry away horse and rider tail
foremost into mid-air! The more the kite pulled and danced
about, the more danced Trelawny, the more frightened he
became, and the tighter he tucked in his tail; the gentleman
who was on the horse caught the string, and bit it in two, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
a native disengaged it from the tail of the animal. A pleasant
bite it must have been, that string covered with pounded glass!
Yah! yah! how very absurd! I wish you had seen the tamāshā.
In the evening we dined with Sir Charles Metcalfe; he was
residing at Papamhow. He told me he was thinking of cutting
down the avenue of nīm trees (melia azadirachta), that led
from the house to the river; I begged hard that it might be
spared, assuring him that the air around nīm trees was reckoned
wholesome by the natives, while that around the tamarind was
considered very much the contrary. In front of my rooms, in
former days, at Papamhow, was a garden, full of choice plants,
and a very fine young India-rubber tree; it was pleasant to see the
bright green of the large glossy leaves of the caoutchouc tree, which
flourished so luxuriantly. In those days, many flowering trees
adorned the spot; among which the katchnar (bauhinia), both white
and rose-coloured and variegated, was remarkable for its beauty.
Sir Charles had destroyed my garden, without looking to see
what trees he was cutting down; he had given the ruthless
order. I spoke of and lamented the havoc he had occasioned;
to recompense me, he promised to spare the avenue; which, when
I revisited it years afterwards, was in excellent preservation.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—The Bāiza Bā’ī sent for me in great haste; she was in
alarm respecting the Gaja Rājā, who was ill of epidemic
fever. Having lost her daughter, the Chimna Bā’ī, of fever,
when she was driven out of Gwalior by her rebellious subjects,
she was in the utmost distress, lest her only remaining hope and
comfort, her young grand-daughter, should be taken from her.
I urged them to call in European medical advice; they hesitated
to do so, as a medical man might neither see the young Princess,
nor feel her pulse. I drove off, and soon returned with the best
native doctress to be procured; but, from what I heard at the
consultation, it may be presumed her skill is not very great.</p>

<p>The Nawāb Hakīm Menhdī is very ill; I fear his days are
numbered.</p>

<p>The murder of Mr. Frazer, by the Nawāb Sumshoodeen, at
Delhi, who bribed a man called Kureem Khan to shoot him, took
place when I was at Colonel Gardner’s; no one could believe it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
when suspicion first fell upon the Nawāb; he had lived on such
intimate terms with Mr. Frazer, who always treated him like a
brother. The Nawāb was tried by Mr. Colvin, the judge, condemned
and executed. The natives at Allahabad told me they
thought it a very unjust act of our Government, the hanging
the Nawāb merely for bribing a man to murder another, and
said, the man who fired the shot ought to have been the
only person executed. On Sunday, the 13th March, 1835,
Kureem Khan was foiled in his attempt on Mr. Frazer’s life, as
the latter was returning from a nāch, given by Hindoo Rāo, the
brother of the Bāiza Bā’ī. He accomplished his purpose eight
days afterwards, on the 22nd of the same month. In the Hon.
Miss Eden’s beautiful work, “The Princes and People of India,”
there is a sketch of Hindoo Rāo on horseback; his being the
brother of the Bāiza Bā’ī is perhaps his most distinguishing
mark; I have understood, however, he by no means equals the
ex-Queen of Gwalior in talent.</p>

<p><i>June 7th.</i>—Sir Charles Metcalfe gave a ball to the station: in
spite of all the thermantidotes and the tattīs it was insufferably
hot; but it is remarkable, that balls are always given and better
attended during the intense heat of the hot winds, than at any
other time.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—The Bāiza Bā’ī sent word she wished to see me ere her
departure, as it was her intention to quit Allahabad and proceed
to the west: a violent rheumatic headache prevented my being
able to attend. The next morning she encamped at Padshah
Bāgh, beyond Allahabad, on the Cawnpore road, where I saw
her the next evening in a small round tent, entirely formed of
tattīs. The day after she quitted the ground and went one
march on the Cawnpore road, when the Kotwal of the city was
sent out by the magistrate to bring her back to Allahabad, and
she was forced to return. Her grand-daughter is very ill, exposed
to the heat and rains in tents. I fear the poor girl’s life
will be sacrificed. Surely she is treated cruelly and unjustly.
She who once reigned in Gwalior has now no roof to shelter
her: the rains have set in; she is forced to live in tents, and
is kept here against her will,—a state prisoner, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>The sickness in our farm-yard is great: forty-seven gram-fed
sheep and lambs have died of small-pox; much sickness is
in the stable, but no horse has been lost in consequence.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Remarkably fine grapes are selling at one rupee the
ser; <i>i.e.</i>, one shilling per pound. The heat is intolerable; and
the rains do not fall heavily, as they ought to do at this season.
The people in the city say the drought is so unaccountable, so
great, that some rich merchant, having large stores of grain of
which to dispose, must have used <i>magic</i> to keep off the rains,
that a famine may ensue, and make his fortune!</p>

<p>1836, <i>June 28th.</i>—A hurricane has blown ever since gun-fire;
clouds of dust are borne along upon the rushing wind; not a
drop of rain; nothing is to be seen but the whirling clouds of
the tūfān. The old peepul-tree moans, and the wind roars in it
as if the storm would tear it up by the roots. The pinnace
at anchor on the Jumna below the bank rolls and rocks; the
river rises in waves, like a little sea. Some of her iron bolts have
been forced out by the pressure of the cables, and the sarang
says, she can scarcely hold to her moorings. I am watching her
unsteady masts, expecting the next gust will tear her from the
bank, and send her off into the rushing and impetuous current.
It is well it is not night, or she would be wrecked to a certainty.
I have not much faith in her weathering such a tūfān at all,
exposed as she is to the power of the stream and the force of the
tempest. High and deep clouds of dust come rushing along
the ground, which, soaring into the highest heaven, spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
darkness with a dull sulphureous tinge, as the red brown clouds of
the tūfān whirl swiftly on. It would almost be an inducement
to go to India, were it only to see a hurricane in all its glory:
the might and majesty of wind and dust: just now the fine
sand from the banks of the river is passing in such volumes on
the air, that the whole landscape has a white hue, and objects
are indistinct; it drives through every crevice, and, although
the windows are all shut, fills my eyes and covers the paper.
It is a fearful gale. I have been out to see if the pinnace is
likely to be driven from her moorings. The waves in the river
are rolling high with crests of foam; a miniature sea. So
powerful were the gusts, with difficulty I was able to stand
against them. Like an Irish hurricane it blew up and down.
At last the falling of heavy rain caused the abatement of the wind.
The extreme heat passed away, the trees, the earth, all nature,
animate and inanimate, exulted in the refreshing rain. Only
those who have panted and longed for the fall of rain can appreciate
the delight with which we hailed the setting in of the rains
after the tūfān.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—This morning the Bā’ī sent down two of her ladies,
one of whom is a celebrated equestrian, quite an Amazon:
nevertheless, in stature small and slight, with a pleasant and
feminine countenance. She was dressed in a long piece of
white muslin, about eighteen yards in length; it was wound
round the body and passed over the head, covering the bosom
entirely: a part of it was brought up tight between the limbs, so
that it had the appearance of full trousers falling to the heels.
An embroidered red Benares shawl was bound round her waist;
in it was placed a sword and a pistol, and a massive silver bangle
was on one of her ancles. Her attendants were present with
two saddle horses, decked in crimson and gold, and ornaments
of silver, after the Mahratta fashion. She mounted a large
bony grey, astride of course, and taking an extremely long
spear in her hand, galloped the horse about in circles, performing
the spear exercise in the most beautiful and graceful
style at full gallop; her horse rearing and bounding, and
showing off the excellence of her riding. Dropping her spear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
she took her matchlock, performing a sort of mimic fight,
turning on her saddle as she retreated at full gallop, and firing
over her horse’s tail. She rode beautifully and most gracefully.
When the exhibition was over, we retired to my dressing-room:
she told me she had just arrived from Juggernāth, and was now
<i>en route</i> to Lahore to Runjeet Singh. She was anxious I should
try the lance exercise on her steed, which I would have done,
had I possessed the four walls of a zenāna, within which to have
made the attempt.</p>

<p>What does Sir Charles Metcalfe intend to do with the poor
Bā’ī? what will be her fate? this wet weather she must be
wretched in tents. The Lieutenant-Governor leaves Allahabad
for Agra, in the course of a day or two.</p>

<p>In the evening I paid my respects to her Highness. I happened
to have on a long rosary and cross of black beads; she
was pleased with it, and asked me to procure some new rosaries
for her, that they might adorn the idols, whom they dress up, like
the images of the saints in France, with all sorts of finery.</p>

<p>She showed me a necklace of gold coins, which appeared to
be Venetian: the gold of these coins is reckoned the purest of
all, and they sell at a high price. The natives assert they come
from the eastward, and declare that to the East is a miraculous
well, into which, if copper coins be thrown, they come out after
a time the very purest of gold. In the sketch entitled “<a href="#plate30">Superstitions
of the Natives</a>,” No. 8 represents a coin of this enchanted
well: they are called Putlī, and the following extract
makes me consider them Venetian:—</p>

<p>“It was in the reign of John Dandolo, 1285, that gold
zecchini (sequins) were first struck in Venice. But before they
could be issued, the Doge had to obtain the permission of the
Emperor and the Pope. These zecchini bore the name and
image of the Doge, at first seated on a ducal throne, but afterwards
he was represented standing; and, finally, in the latter
times of the Republic, on his knees, receiving from the hands of
St. Mark the standard of the Republic.”</p>

<p>The necklace, which was a wedding present to the bride, consisted
of three rows of silken cords, as thickly studded with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
these coins as it was possible to put them on, the longest string
reaching to the knees: it was very heavy, and must have been
valuable. Another Mahratta lady wore a necklace of the same
description, but it consisted of a single row, which reached
from her neck to her feet: people less opulent wear merely one,
two, or three putlīs around the neck.</p>

<p>An old Muhammadan darzī of the Shī’ā sect asked me one
morning to be allowed to go to the bazār to purchase a putlī
(a doll) to bind upon his forehead, to take away a violent pain
in his head. This request of his puzzled me greatly: at the
time I was ignorant that putlī was also the name of the charmed
coin, as well as that of a doll. He told me he had recovered
from severe headache before in consequence of this application,
and believed the remedy infallible. The Bā’ī mentioned that
she struck mohurs and half mohurs at Gwalior, in her days of
prosperity. I showed her some new rupees struck by the East
India Company, with the king’s head upon them, which, having
examined, she said, “These rupees are very paltry, there is so
little pure silver in them.”</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—The ladies of the station held a fancy fair at the theatre
for the benefit of the Blind Asylum, which realized one hundred
and eighty pounds.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—Sir Charles quitted this station for Agra, leaving Allahabad
to return to its usual routine of quietness. The thermantidotes
have been stopped, rain has fallen plentifully, the trees
have put on their freshest of greens, and the grass is springing
up in every direction. How agreeable, how pleasant to the eye
is all this luxuriant verdure!</p>

<p>The report in the bazār is, that a native of much wealth and
consideration went into his zenāna tents, in which he found two
of his wives and a man; the latter escaped; he killed both the
women. A zenāna is a delightful place for private murder, and
the manner in which justice is distributed between the sexes is
so impartial! A man may have as many wives as he pleases, and
mistresses without number;—it only adds to his dignity! If a
woman take a lover, she is murdered, and cast like a dog into a
ditch. It is the same all the world over; the women, being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
weaker, are the playthings, the drudges, or the victims of the men;
a woman is a slave from her birth; and the more I see of life,
the more I pity the condition of the women. As for the manner
in which the natives strive to keep them virtuous, it is absurd; a
girl is affianced at three or four years old, married, without
having seen the man, at eleven, shut up and guarded and suspected
of a wish to intrigue, which, perhaps, first puts it into
her head; and she amuses herself with outwitting those who
have no dependence upon her, although, if discovered, her death
generally ends the story.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—How weary and heavy is life in India, when stationary!
Travelling about the country is very amusing; but during the
heat of the rains, shut up in the house, one’s mind and body
feel equally enervated. I long for a bracing sea breeze, and a
healthy walk through the green lanes of England; the lovely
wild flowers,—their beauty haunts me. Here we have no wild
flowers; from the gardens you procure the most superb nosegays;
but the lovely wild flowers of the green lanes are wanting.
Flowering trees are planted here on the sides of the roads, and
I delight in bringing home a bouquet.</p>

<p>A steamer comes up every month from Calcutta; she tows a
tug, that is, a large flat vessel, which carries the passengers.
The steamers answer well; but what ugly-looking, mercantile
things they are!</p>

<p>I must give an extract from the letter of a friend, describing
an adventure, such as you would not meet with in the green
lanes of Hampshire:—“The boat was getting on slowly, and I
went into the hills at Rajmahal, to get a deer or peacock or
jungle-fowl, in fact, something for the kitchen. Some way in
the interior I heard a queer noise, which one of my servants
said was a deer; as I could not draw the shot in my gun (which
is a single barrel flint) to substitute a ball, having only a make-shift
ramrod, I consoled myself that the shot was large, and
pushed on in the direction of the noise, which still continued. As
I came on the upper end of a hollow in the side of the hill,
filled with jungle and long grass, some animal jumped up at
about fifteen yards in front; he was evidently large, and what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the great composers of the ‘Sporting Magazine’ term, of
a fulvous colour; he was decidedly, in the opinion of the beaters,
a very heavy deer, of three or four mŭns. Hark forward! was
now the word, as the same great composers would again say;
we crossed a hollow road, entered the jungle on the opposite
side, a little below the direction the animal had taken,
and had not gone fifteen yards when up rose, without hurry,
a handsome large tiger, just out of arm’s length, and a little
from behind me; his gait was slunk and shuffling; I saw
at once that he was going <i>from</i> me, and, owing to that circumstance,
I passed in review his sleeky flank and black stripes with
much pleasure. I was a good deal excited, it being my first
wild beast sight <i>au naturel</i>; I almost felt an inclination to slap
my shot at him.”</p>

<p>The sketch, entitled “<a href="#plate31">The Spring Bow</a>,” was taken in the
Rajmahal hills, not far from the jungle in which my friend saw
the tiger; the <i>bête sauvage</i> represented in it might perhaps have
been the very one whose sleeky flank and black stripes he
viewed with so much pleasure.</p>

<p><i>August.</i>—The cows are now in the finest order possible; they
are fed on Lucerne grass and cotton seed, and go out grazing.
The cotton seed is considered very fattening for cattle; it is
separated, by the aid of a very simple machine, from the fine
white cotton in which it is immersed in the cells of the capsule;
and this work is usually performed by women. Butter is made
every morning and evening; and, now and then, a cream cheese.
The butter is very fine, of a bright yellow colour, and the cream
cheese excellent. The extra butter having been clarified, and
sealed down in jars, keeps good for twelve months.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Nagapanchmee: This day is sacred to the demigods,
in the form of serpents; the natives smear the doors of their
houses with cow-dung and nīm-leaves, to preserve them from
poisonous reptiles. Nīm-leaves are put amongst shawls and
clothes, and also in books, to defend them from moths and insects.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—During the night it began to blow most furiously,
accompanied by heavy rain and utter darkness; so fierce a tūfān
I never witnessed before. It blew without cessation, raining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
heavily at intervals; and the trees were torn up by their roots.
At 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the storm became so violent, it wrecked twenty large
native salt boats just below our house; the river roared and
foamed, rising in high waves from the opposition of the wind
and stream. Our beautiful pinnace broke from her moorings,
was carried down the stream a short distance, driven against the
broken bastions of the old city of Prag, which have fallen into the
river, and totally wrecked just off the Fort; she went down
with all her furniture, china, books, wine, &amp;c., on board, and has
never been seen or heard of since; scarcely a vestige has been
discovered. Alas! my beautiful Seagull; she has folded her
wings for ever, and has sunk to rest! We can only rejoice no
lives were lost, and that we were not on board; the sarang and
khalāsīs (sailors) swam for their lives; they were carried some
distance down the stream, below the Fort, and drifted on a
sandbank. The headless image of the satī, that graced the
cabin, had brought rather too much wind. When the sarang
lamented her loss, I could only repeat, as on the day he carried
off the lady, “Chorī ke mal nā’īch hazm hota,”—stolen food
cannot be digested: <i>i.e.</i> ill deeds never thrive.</p>

<p>The cook-boat was swamped. On the going down of the river,
although she was in the mud, with her back broken, she was
sold, and brought the sum we originally gave for her when new;—such
was the want of boats, occasioned by the numbers that
were lost in the storm! The next morning, three of the Venetians
and the companion-ladder of the pinnace were washed
ashore below the Fort, and brought to us by a fisherman. We
were sorry for the fate of the Seagull; she was a beautifully
built vessel, but not to be trusted, the white ants had got into
her. The mischief those white ants do is incalculable; they
pierce the centre of the masts and beams, working on in the
dark, seldom showing marks of their progress outside, unless
during the rains. Sometimes a mast, to all appearance sound,
will snap asunder; when it will be discovered the centre has
been hollowed by the white ants, and the outside is a mere
wooden shell. Almost all the trees in the garden were blown
down by the gale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 6th.</i>—I visited the Mahratta camp, to witness the celebration
of the anniversary of the birth of Krishnŭ; an account
of the ceremonies and of the life of Kaniyā-jee shall be given in
a separate chapter.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 19th.</i>—The Commander-in-Chief, Sir Henry Fane,
arrived; his tents are pitched before the Fort, on the side of the
Jumna; the elephants, the camels, and the horses in attendance
form a picturesque assemblage, much to my taste.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—The station gave a ball to Sir Henry and his party;
he is a magnificent-looking man, with good soldier-like bearing,
one of imposing presence, a most superb bow, and graceful
speaking. I admire his appearance, and think he must have
merited his appellation, in olden times, of the handsome
aide-de-camp.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Sir Henry Fane reviewed the troops of the station,
and a ball took place in the evening, at the house of Mr. Fane,
the brother of the Commander-in-Chief. A few days afterwards,
the ladies of his family requested me to accompany them to
visit her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī, which I did with much
pleasure, and acted as interpreter.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 3rd.</i>—We dined with Sir Henry in camp, and he promised
to show me tiger-shooting in perfection, if I would accompany
his party to Lucnow.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—Some friends anchored under our garden, on their way
to Calcutta; the sight of their little fleet revived all my roaming
propensities, and, as I wished to consult a medical man at the
Residency, in whom I had great faith, I agreed to join their
party, and make a voyage down the river. The Bāiza Bā’ī was
anxious to see my friends; we paid her a farewell visit; she
was charmed with Mr. C⸺, who speaks and understands the
language like a native, and delighted with the children.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Our little fleet of six vessels quitted Allahabad, and
three days afterwards we arrived at Mirzapore, famous for its
beautiful ghāts and carpet manufactories.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Anchored under the Fort of Chunar, a beautiful
object from the river; it was not my intention to have anchored
there, but the place looked so attractive, I could not pass by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
without paying it a visit. The goats and sheep, glad to get a
run after their confinement in the boat, are enjoying themselves
on the bank; and a boy, with a basket full of snakes (cobra di
capello), is trying to attract my attention. In the cool of the
evening we went into the Fort, which is situated on the top of
an abrupt rock, which rises from the river. The view, coming
from Allahabad, is very striking; the ramparts running along the
top of the rising ground, the broad open river below; the
churchyard under the walls, on the banks of the Gunga, with
its pretty tombs of Chunar stone rising in all sorts of pointed
forms, gives one an idea of quiet, not generally the feeling that
arises on the sight of a burial-place in India; the ground was
open, and looked cheerful as the evening sun fell on the tombs;
the hills, the village, the trees, all united in forming a scene of
beauty. We entered the magazine, and visited the large black
slab on which the deity of the Fort is said to be ever present,
with the exception of from daybreak until the hour of 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
during which time he is at Benares. Tradition asserts that the
Fort has never been taken by the English, but during the
absence of their god Burtreenath. We walked round the
ramparts, and enjoyed the view. The church, and the houses
which stretch along the river-side for some distance, and the
Fort itself, looked cheerful and healthy; which accounted for the
number of old pensioners to be found at Chunar, who have
their option as to their place of residence.</p>

<p>As you approach Benares, on the left bank of the river,
stands the house of the Rājā of Benares, a good portly looking
building. The appearance of the Holy City from the river is
very curious, and particularly interesting. The steep cliff on
which Benares is built is covered with Hindoo temples and ghāts
of all sizes and descriptions; the first ghāt, built by Appa
Sāhib, from Poona, I thought handsome; but every ghāt was
eclipsed by the beauty of the one which is now being built by
her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī; the scale is so grand, so beautiful,
so light, and it is on so regular a plan, it delighted me; it is the
handsomest ghāt I have seen in India; unfinished as it is, it has
cost her Highness fifteen lākh; to finish it will cost twenty lākh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
more; should she die ere the work be completed it will never
be finished, it being deemed unlucky to finish the work of a
deceased person. The money, to the amount of thirty-seven
lākh, which the Bā’ī had stored in her house at Benares, to
complete the ghāt, and to feed the Brahmāns, whose allowance
was two hundred rupees, <i>i.e.</i> £20 a day, has been seized by
the Government, and put into the Company’s treasury, where
it will remain until the point now in dispute is settled; that is,
whether it belong to the Bā’ī or to her adopted son, the present
Mahārāj of Gwalior, who forced her out of the kingdom.
Several Hindoo temples are near this ghāt; a cluster of
beauty. Two chiraghdanīs, which are lighted up on festivals,
are curious and pretty objects; their effect, when glittering at
night with thousands of little lamps, must be beautiful, reflected
with the temples, and crowds of worshippers on the waters
below; and great picturesque beauty is added to the scene by
the grotesque and curious houses jutting out from the cliff,
based on the flights of stone steps which form the ghāts. How
I wished I could have seen Benares from the river during the
Dewalī, or Festival of Lights! At sunset we went up the
Minarets, built by Aurunzebe; they are considered remarkably
beautiful, towering over the Hindoo temples; a record of the
Muhammadan conquest.</p>

<p>On my return to my budjerow, a number of native merchants
were in waiting, hoping to dispose of their goods to the strangers;
they had boxes full of Benares turbans, shawls, gold and silver
dresses, kimkhwāab, and cloth of gold. This place is famous for
its embroidery in gold, and for its tissues of gold and silver. I
purchased some to make a native dress for myself, and also
some very stiff ribbon, worked in silk and gold, on which are
the names of all the Hindoo deities; the Hindoos wear them
round their necks; they are holy, and called junéoo. The
English mare and my little black horse met me here, <i>en route</i> to
Calcutta.</p>

<p>The Bāiza Bā’ī told me by no means to pass Benares without
visiting her ghāt and her house; some of her people having
come down to the river, I returned with them to see the house;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
it is very curiously situated in the heart of the city. Only
imagine how narrow the street is which leads up to it; as I sat
in my palanquin, I could touch both the sides of the street by
stretching my arms out, which I did to assure myself of its
extreme narrowness. All the houses in this street are five or
six stories high. We stopped at the house of the Bā’ī; it is six
stories high, and was bought by her Highness as a place in which
to secure her treasure. It is difficult to describe a regular
Hindoo house such as this; which consists of four walls, within
and around which the rooms are built story above story; but
from the foundation to the top of the house there is a square in
the centre left open, so that the house encloses a small square
court open to the sky above, around which the rooms are built
with projecting platforms, on which the women may sit,
and <i>eat the air</i>, as the natives call it, within the walls of
their residence. I clambered up the narrow and deep stone
stairs, story after story, until I arrived at the top of the house;
the view from which was unique: several houses in the neighbourhood
appeared much higher than the one on which I was
standing, which was six stories high. The Mahratta, who did
the honours on the part of her Highness, took me into one of
the rooms, and showed me the two chests of cast iron, which
formerly contained about eighteen thousand gold mohurs. The
Government took that money from the Bā’ī by force, and put it
into their treasury. Her Highness refused to give up the keys,
and also refused her sanction to the removal of the money from
her house; the locks of the iron chests were driven in, and the
tops broken open; the rupees were in bags in the room; the
total of the money removed amounted to thirty-seven lākh.
Another room was full of copper coins; another of cowries;
the latter will become mouldy and fall into dust in the course of
time. One of the gentlemen of the party went over the house
with me, and saw what I have described. Atr and pān were
presented, after which we took our leave and proceeded to the
market-place. The braziers’ shops were open, but they refused
to sell any thing, it being one of the holidays on which no worker
in brass is allowed to sell goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>The worship of Vishwŭ-kŭrma, the son of Brŭmha, the
architect of the gods, was perhaps being performed. On that
day blacksmiths worship their hammer and bellows; carpenters,
the mallet, chisel, hatchet, saw, &amp;c.; washermen, their irons;
and potters, the turning-wheel, as the representative of this god.
The festival closes with singing and gaiety, smoking and eating.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—The hour was too early, and but few shops were open,
which gave a dull look to this generally crowded and busy city.</p>

<p>The air is cool and pleasant; we float gently down the river;
this quiet, composed sort of life, with a new scene every day, is
one of great enjoyment.</p>

<p>I must not forget to mention that, after a considerable lapse
of time, the treasure that was detained by the Government on
behalf of the young Mahārāj of Gwalior, was restored to her
Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī.</p>

<p>1836, <i>Nov. 21st.</i>—Arrived early at Ghāzīpūr, the town of Ghāzī,
also called, as the Hindūs assert, Gādhpūr, from Gādh, a Rājā
of that name. We went on shore to view the tomb of a former
Governor-General, the Marquis Cornwallis, who lies buried here,
aged sixty-seven. The sarcophagus is within a circular building,
surmounted by a dome, and surrounded by a verandah; it is of
white marble, with appropriate figures in half relief by Flaxman;
in front is a bust of the Marquis; the coronet and cushion
surmount it; the iron railings are remarkably handsome and
appropriate; the whole is surrounded by a plantation of fine
young trees, and kept in excellent order; in front is a pedestal,
intended, I should imagine, for a statue of the Marquis. The
view from the building is open and pretty; it is situated in the
cantonment on the banks of the Ganges. There are four
figures in mourning attitudes on the tomb, in half relief; that of
a Brahmān is well executed. The pakka houses of the European
residents at Ghāzīpūr, stretching along the river’s side, have a
pleasing effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>The ruins of the palace of the Nawāb of Ghāzīpūr are
situated on a high bank, in front of which the rampart, with
four bastions, faces the river. The house is falling into ruins.
I admired it very much, the plan on which it is built is charming;
what a luxurious abode during the hot winds! It is situated on
a high bank overlooking the Gunga; in the centre is an octagonal
room; around this, four square rooms alternate with four
octagonal rooms, which are supported on light and handsome
arches. There are no walls to the rooms, but each is supported
on arches. Around the centre room is a space for water, and
a great number of fountains played there in former times.
Between the arches hung rich pardas; how delightfully suited
to the climate! Imagine the luxury of sitting in the centre
room, all the air coming in cooled by the fountains, and screened
from the glare by the rich pardas! One of the octagonal rooms
has fallen in completely. A gentleman of our party, not finding
any game in the surrounding fields, shot five anwarī fish that
were sporting about on the surface of the river. Rose-water
and cloth was brought for sale in abundance. The fields by the
river-side are in parts a perfect Golgotha, strewn with human
skulls. The Company’s stud is here, but we did not visit it.</p>

<p>Off the village of Beerpūr I saw from ten to twenty satī
mounds, under some large trees by the river-side; the idea of
what those wretched women must have suffered made me
shudder.</p>

<p>Off Chounsah I was most thoroughly disgusted; there is on
the bank of the river a murda ghāt, or place for burning the dead
bodies of the Hindūs; about twenty charpāīs (native beds) were
there cast away as unclean, the bodies having been carried down
upon them. Some of the bodies had hardly been touched by
the fire, just scorched and thrown into the water. The dogs and
crows were tearing the flesh from the skeletons, growling as
they ate, to deter other dogs that stood snarling around from
joining in the meal. A gentleman fired at them, drove off some
of the dogs, and killed others; you have no idea how fierce and
hungry the wretches were; a bullet from a musket only scared
them for a moment, and then they returned to the corpse. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
was glad to get beyond the murda ghāt; the sight and smell of
such horrors made me ill.</p>

<p>Anchored at Buxar, and visited the stud; the only stable I
went into was a most admirable one, lofty, airy, ventilated, clean,
and spacious. It contained two hundred horses, all looking
clean, and in excellent condition; the horses in this stable are
all three years old, remarkably fine young animals. You may
have the choice of the stable for £100, <i>i.e.</i> 1000 rupees; these
horses ought to be good, they come from the best imported
English, Arab, and Persian horses, and are reared with great
care. The animals stand in a long line, without any separation
or bar between them in the stable; the head is tied to the
manger, the heels at liberty, no heel-ropes. They appear perfectly
quiet, although they stand so close to each other. About
six hundred horses are at Buxar, and more on the other side of the
river; I derived much pleasure from seeing the stud at this place,
and regret I did not visit that at Ghāzīpūr. Every day, from
7 to 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the whole of the young horses are turned loose into
a paddock, to run and gallop about at pleasure; it must be a
pretty sight.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—The melā at Bulliah is held on this day, the last
of the month of Kartik. The scene for five miles was very
gay; a great Hindū fair and bathing day; boats full of people
going to the fair, numbers on the cliff, and crowds in the river,
at their devotions,—an animated scene. The gentlemen are
firing ball at the great crocodiles, as they lie basking on the
sandbanks; they have killed a very large one. When crocodiles
are cut open, silver and gold ornaments are sometimes
found in the interior; the body of a child—the whole body—was
found in a crocodile, a short time ago, at Cawnpore.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—This morning our little fleet passed the Soane river at its
junction with the Ganges; I went on deck to look at the kala panī,
<i>the black water</i>, as the natives call it, on account of the deep blue
tinge of the Soane, which forms a strong contrast to the dingy
milky hue of the stream of the Gunga. In this river, agates,
amethysts, cornelians, &amp;c., are found. Crossing the river, which
was considerably agitated by a very powerful wind, to go to the fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
at Hājīpūr, I saw a man apparently standing on the waters in
the centre of the river; it was blowing a stiff gale; the man
stood in an erect and easy position. On coming nearer I perceived
he was standing on the back of an elephant; the whole
of the animal’s body, with the exception of his head, was under
water; he put up the end of his trunk every now and then, and
was swimming boldly and strongly forward directly across the
enormous river. The wind blew so heavily, it was surprising
the man could keep his balance; he held a string in one hand,
the other contained the ankus, with which the mahāwat drives
his elephant; the string was, perhaps, the reins fastened in the
animal’s ears, with which they often guide them.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 25th we arrived at Hājīpūr; it was
very provoking to see all the tents being struck, and the vessels
going down the stream, as we were rowing up it,—a day too
late for the fair. Hājīpūr is situated at the junction of the
Gunduc with the Ganges; the Gunduc is such a rapid stream,
it is hardly possible to stem it, at least with a foul wind, such as
we had at the time of our arrival. We went on shore, and
procured provisions; returning, we crossed the Gunduc in a
boat hollowed out of the stem of a tree,—not a very safe sort of
concern, but very common on the Ganges.</p>

<p>What an uncomfortable night I spent! awakened every half-hour
by the falling in of the sandbank to which my budgerow
was moored; I feared my cook boat would have been swamped.
In the middle of the night a great cry was raised of “Chor,
Chor!” and a number of people rushed down to seize a thief,
who was floating down the rapid Gunduc, with a gharā (an
earthen pot) over his head; a trick common to thieves, that they
may pass unperceived. I got up, hearing the noise, and looked
out of the cabin window; seeing a man in the water close under
the window, and imagining him to be one of the sailors, I said,
“What is all this noise about?” The thief, for it was he, finding
he was not concealed by the shadow of the vessel, swam off; and,
although a boat pursued him, he escaped by either crossing the
Ganges or floating down it. These thieves are most wonderfully
skilful, and infest the great fairs of India; my servants say he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
had a large box with him in the water, and floated down upon
it; it was stolen from the tent of a rich native.</p>

<p>Off the village of Futwa I purchased a quantity of Patna
tablecloths, napkins, and cloth; the manufactory is at this place;
and the people bring their goods off to the passing vessels.</p>

<p>The whole way from Allahabad to Patna the fan palm
trees (borassus flabelliformis) are extremely scarce; immediately
below Patna the river’s bank is covered with them. The natives
call them tar or tarie trees; the juice is used as leaven for bread,
also as urruk. A single leaf is sufficient to form the large hand
pankhās used by the bearers, and paper is also manufactured
from the tarie tree. They add greatly to the picturesque and
Eastern beauty of the scene.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Arrived at Monghir: the place looks very well from
the river with its old Fort. On anchoring we were assailed by
a number of people, all anxious to sell their goods,—chairs,
work-tables, boxes, straw bonnets and hats, birds in cages, forks,
knives, guns, pistols, baskets, kettles; and to the noise of such
a collection of people, all howling and shouting, was added the
whining of a host of beggars.</p>

<p>We went on shore, and walked through the bazār, buying a
number of queer things. After tiffin we proceeded in palkees to
the Seetā Khoond, about five miles from Monghir, the road very
good, date and palm trees in abundance; and the country around
Seetā’s Well makes one imagine that one is approaching the
sea-shore; there is a remarkably volcanic appearance in the
rocks. The Seetā Khoond is a brilliantly clear spring of boiling
hot water, which bubbles and boils up most beautifully, and is
enclosed in a large space, with steps descending to the water.
I never saw so beautiful a spring, or such living water! There are
four springs close to it, but they are all of cold water, and have
none of the clearness or beauty of Seetā’s Well. The water is
contained in an enclosure of stone, in which it rises up sparkling
and bubbling from its rocky bed. The steps on which you stand
are very hot, and a hot steam rises from the surface; the water
is so clear you can see the points at which it springs up from its
bed of rock. The stream from the Seetā Khoond is constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
flowing into the jheel below in a little rivulet, that gradually
widens, and in which the presence of the hot water is perceptible
in a cold morning for about one hundred yards from the
spring.</p>

<p>Several years ago, an artilleryman attempted for a wager to
swim across the basin, and although he succeeded in getting
over, it was necessary to convey him to an hospital, where he
died within a few hours from the effect of the hot water; not
having tested it by a thermometer, I cannot tell the precise
heat. The Brahmāns say, so holy is the well, by the power of
the goddess Seetā, that, although boiling, it performs the miracle
of keeping rice and eggs thrown into it in an uncooked state.
I saw a great quantity of rice which remained unswollen in the
water; not being a pious Hindū, I conclude the water to be
below the boiling point.</p>

<p>A pretty Hindū temple has been erected close to the spring,
dedicated to Seetā, in which are four idols; one of the god
Rām, his beloved Seetā, his brother Lutchman, and their champion
the monkey god Hoonumān; in the verandah is also a
statue of Hoonumān. I put the points of my fingers into the
water, but the heat was too near the scalding point to allow of
my putting in my hand; the view from the spring is remarkably
beautiful; in front is a jheel, a large space of shallow water,
bounded by the Kurrukpūr mountains at various distances;
these mountains are rather rocks than mountains, and the stones
took all sorts of grotesque forms as the sun declined behind
them. On the right and left of the spring were rocks, which
appeared to have been thrown up by an earthquake. The jheel
looking like a place in which snipe and wild ducks would be
plentiful, one of the party took his gun and shot over it, but
had no sport; the morning is the time for finding birds there.
I walked half-way down the jheel: looking back towards the
Khoond, the white temples at the spring, with the dark green
mango tope behind, and the wild-looking, rocky scenery on either
side, had a pleasing effect. The palkee-bearers told me, in the
centre of the opposite mountains, the Kurrukpūr, about six
miles from the Seetā Khoond, there is a hot spring, called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Reeçee Khoond, which, from being in the jungles, is little known;
that every third year a fair is held there, when people assemble
to bathe and do pooja. My friends filled many bottles at the
spring; it is necessary to bring corks, as they are not procurable
at Monghir. The water is so pure, it keeps like the Bristol
water on a long voyage; people returning to England make a
point of stopping here on that account.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—We anchored at the Fakīr’s rock at Janghīra. The
abode of the Fakīr is on a high bold rock, rising abruptly in the
midst of the stream, completely isolated; the temple is placed
on the very summit; there are four small temples also a little
below; some large trees spring from the crevices of the rock:
the whole reflected in the Ganges, with the village of Janghīra
beyond, and the mountains of Karrak in the distance, form a
good subject for the pencil. On the outside, carved on the solid
rock, are a great number of Hindoo images; amongst them,
one of Narasingh is very conspicuous, tearing open the bowels of
the king who disbelieved the omnipresence of the Deity. We
passed over in a little boat to see this temple; the fakīrs showed
it with great good will, and gained a small reward. There is a
remarkably fine tree, the plumeria alba, springing from the side
of the rock, the goolachin or junglee champa, as the natives call
it. On our return to the main land, we climbed a cluster of
rocks, just opposite Janghīra; on the summit of these rocks,
which are well wooded, stand the ruins of an ancient mosque; no
one inhabits the place; the view from the platform is remarkably
good. The graves of the Kāzī Biskermee’s family are there;
the Kāzī formerly lived there, but I could not gain much information
from our guide on the subject. The little burial-ground,
with its eleven graves, looked so quiet, and afar from the turmoil
of the world, I took a fancy to the spot. There must, or there
ought to be, some little history attached to this picturesque
mosque and its ruined graves; it stands on a high rock, well
wooded, rising abruptly from the Ganges.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 1st.</i>—We quitted the Janghīra rocks ere daybreak, with
a fair wind, and floated down the stream most agreeably; in the
evening we arrived at Colgong, which presents much picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
beauty; four rocky islands of considerable height, rock piled on
rock, rise and stretch across the centre of the Ganges. As we
sailed past them, I saw five or six of the smallest, lightest, and
most fairy-looking little boats gliding about the rocks, in which
men were fishing; the fish are large, excellent, and abundant.
No one resides on these rocks. The village of Kuhulgaon, commonly
called Colgong, is situated under some hills, and prettily
wooded. The cook boat not having arrived, one of the gentlemen
fired his gun off, to direct the men where to find us; the sound
was returned from the rocks four times, distinctly and loudly, with
an interval of four or five seconds between each echo. We took a
walk in the evening; Mr. ⸺ killed a flying fox, or vampire
bat, such a curious-looking animal, with a most intelligent little
face; the body was covered with hair; its leathern wings
measured from tip to tip three feet eight inches and a half.</p>

<p>No one ought to take up-country dāndees; they ensure
much plague and trouble. The Bengalees having their homes in
Calcutta, do not desert going down the river. At Monghir the
mānjhī and six dāndees deserted to their homes; this detained
and annoyed us.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>—Early in the evening we anchored at Sickrī-galī, a
place close upon the Rajmahal Hills, and went out shooting.
The dāndees, with long poles, accompanied us to beat the
bushes. The people say wild beasts often come to this place at
night, and a few miles below there is good tiger shooting; we
found no game, being too near the village: had we proceeded
further into the hills, we must have had some sport in the wild
country around them. Night came on ere we regained the
boats.</p>

</figure>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—Mr. ⸺ sallied forth with his beaters to try the
marshy plain under the hills of the Sickrī-galī Pass. The cool
morning tempted me out, and the first person whom I saw was
an indigo planter standing near his bungalow, the only European
dwelling-house at the place. On asking him where good
shooting was to be found, he said the road the gentleman had taken
was one in which game of all sorts abounded, but that on
account of tigers it was dangerous. He showed me the marks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of tiger’s paws in his garden. His account rather gave me a
curiosity to see the sort of plain where such animals <i>may</i> be
found; and with a chaprāsī, and a bearer carrying a large chatr,
I took the road to the rocks. After a very long walk, we came
to a most suspicious-looking spot, surrounded by very high
jungle-grass, beyond which stretched the deep woods and hills of
Rajmahal. “In this direction,” said my chaprāsī, “is the very
spot frequented by tigers, here they may be found;” and we
pushed through the heavy jungle grass from nine to twelve feet
in height, and so thick it was almost impenetrable. “Here is
some water,” said the man, “and here, on its edge, the prints
fresh on the marshy soil of the feet of a tiger! Look, look, mem
sāhiba, it is true, it is true, here they are!” I forced a passage
for myself through the grass, and saw the foot-marks. “He
who has never seen a tiger, let him look at a cat; and he who
has never seen a thief, let him look at a butcher<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.”</p>

<p>My anxiety to see a <i>bête sauvage</i>, <i>a royal Bengal tiger</i>, in his
native wilderness, making me forgetful that his presence might
prove dangerous, induced me to scan the jungle on every side.
“Are we likely to see a tiger?” said I to the man. “Not at this
hour, mem sāhiba, see, the sun is high in heaven;” pointing to
the hill, “they are up there in the recesses of the mountain, in
the shade of the deep forests; when the shadows of evening fall,
if the mem sāhiba will return to this spot she will be sure to
see the tigers, at that hour they come down to quench their
thirst at this water.” At night, on my return to the boats, I
remembered the words of the chaprāsī, but did not feel inclined
to go out on such a “will-you-come-and-be-killed” expedition.</p>

<p>On this spot the baghmars, (tiger killers,) set up the spring-bow
with a poisoned arrow: the bow is made of strong bamboo,
supported on two cross sticks, to one end of which a string is
fastened that crosses the wild beast’s track; as soon as the tiger
touches the cord in crossing it to the water’s edge, it releases
the bow-string, and the arrow, being immediately discharged
with great force, enters the body of the beast just about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
height of his heart. A poisoned arrow was thus set for a tiger
in Assam, who was found dead sixty yards from the spot—so
quickly does the deadly poison take effect. A further account
of this bow will be found in a subsequent chapter. The place
was one of great interest; the water was surrounded by the
high grass; on one side was a cluster of forest trees, and beneath
them the slight and delicate bābul. The By’ā birds were flitting
about; they delight in placing their long nests on the extreme
end of the slight branches of the bābul, pendant over a stream
or pool for security. For a further account of these sagacious
little birds, see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_220">vol. i. page 220</a>.</p>

<p>The bright sunshine, the deep reflections on the water, the
idea that there was danger lurking around, all combined to
render this picturesque and secluded spot one of great interest.</p>

<p>The dāndees from the boats that anchor at Sikrī-galī, go up
the hills in gangs to cut wood for firing, and bring it down in
great quantities. Following their track, I soon joined the party
who were shooting snipes in the marsh at the foot of the hills,
and at the moment of my arrival, Mr. ⸺ was busily pulling
the leeches off his ancles, which had stuck to them in passing
through the water. Being fagged with the walk, I got a hackery
from a village; it is a sort of cart made of bamboos with small,
heavy, clumsy, wooden wheels, drawn by two bullocks. Seated in
this conveyance, I desired the man to drive me into the hills.
My bones were half dislocated, bumping up and down in such
a jungle of a place, over high stones that all but upset the cart,
or through the marsh in which the bullocks sometimes being
unable to keep on their feet, took six or seven steps on their
knees; it was a marvel how the little animals got on, or through
such places as we crossed. I went deep into the hills, admiring
the beautiful climbers that were in the greatest profusion, and the
bearer gathered all the novelties, which made me quite happy in
my cart, surrounded by specimens new to me. At last the driver
said he could proceed no further; therefore I walked up the
hill some distance until I was fagged: the view was very
pleasing, looking down the valley over the plain to the Ganges,
where the vessels were sailing past. At a bright running stream<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
I gladly quenched my thirst, having taken no breakfast, and it
being now nearly eleven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Mounted on my bone-breaking
cart, I rejoined my friend, who had only killed five snipe and
another bird. He saw but one black partridge, no deer; the
game was very scarce.</p>

<p>Elephants here are absolutely necessary to enable a man to
enjoy shooting amidst the high grass and thorny thickets. The
place is so much disturbed by the people who go into the hills
for wood, that the game retreat farther into the jungle. Had
we had an elephant, we might have found a tiger; until I have
seen one in his own domains, I shall not sleep in peace. The
khidmatgārs arrived on a cart with bread, meat, tea, and wine.
It being one <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and the sun powerful, we seated ourselves
under a tree, and made an excellent breakfast, which was most
refreshing after such a ramble.</p>

<p>As we were tossing the bones to the little spaniels, we met
with an adventure, which, bringing for the second time in my
life uncivilized beings before me, quite delighted me. The footpath
from the interior of the hills led to the place where we
were seated. Down this path came a most delightful group, a
family of savages, who attracted my attention by the singularity
of their features, the smallness and activity of their bodies,
their mode of gathering their hair in a knot on the top of
their heads, and their wild-looking bows and arrows. We
called these good-natured, gay-looking people around us; they
appeared pleased at being noticed, and one of the women offered
me some young heads of Indian corn, which she took from a
basket she carried on her head containing their principal provision,
this boiled and mashed Indian corn. She also carried a
child seated astride upon her hip. A child is rarely seen in a
woman’s arms, as in Europe. The same custom appears to have
existed amongst the Jews: “Ye shall be borne upon her sides,
and dandled upon her knees.”—<i>Isaiah.</i></p>

<p>The party consisted of a man and three boys, apparently
eight, twelve, and sixteen years of age, two women, and
a little girl. The man said he had come from a place four coss
within the hills, by our calculation eight miles, but hill measurement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of distance being generally liberal, I should suppose it
double that distance. Their descent at this time to the plains,
was to help in gathering in the present crop of uncut rice, for
which purpose the owners of the fields had asked them to come
down. The man appeared to be about five feet in height,
remarkable for lightness and suppleness of limb, with the
piercing and restless eye that is said to be peculiar to savages.
His countenance was round and happy; the expression had
both cunning and simplicity; the nose depressed between the
eyes, and altogether a face that one laughed to look at. His
black hair drawn tight up in a knot on the very top of the head,
the ends fastened in with a wooden comb. His only clothing
a small piece of linen bound around his middle. He carried a
bow of hill bamboo, the string of which was formed out of
the twisted rind of the bamboo, and the four arrows were of
the common reed, headed with iron barbs of different shapes;
one of the barbs was poisoned. The hill-man said he had
bought the poison into which the barb had been dipped of a
more remote hill tribe, and was ignorant of its nature: he begged
us not to handle the point. The natives will not mention
the name of the plant from which the poison is procured; it
appears to be a carefully-guarded secret. On each arrow were
strips of feather from the wing of the vulture. The boy was
similarly dressed, and armed. The woman, who carried the
child, appeared to be the favourite from the number of ornaments
on her person. She was extremely small in stature, but
fat and well-looking. Unlike the women of the plains, she wore
no covering on her head, and but little on her body. Two or
three yards of cloth were around her waist, and descended half
way below the knees; whilst a square of the same was tied over
her shoulders like a monkey mantle; passed under the left arm
it was drawn over the bosom, and the ends tied on the shoulder
of the right arm. Her hair was tied up in the same fashion as
the man’s. Around the rim of each ear were twenty-three thin
ear-rings of brass; and three or four necklaces of red and white
beads hung down to her waist in gradations. Her nose-ring
was moderately large in circumference, but very heavy, pulling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
down the right nostril by its weight; it was of silver, with four
large beads, and an ornament of curious form. She had thick
purple glass rings on her arms, called churees, of coarse manufacture,
and other ornaments which I forget, something of the
same sort.</p>

<p>She talked openly and freely. I took the man’s bow, and shot
an arrow after the English fashion; at which the whole family
laughed excessively, and appeared to think it so absurd that I
should not draw a bow in the style of a mountaineer. I begged the
man to show me the proper method; he put a sort of ring on my
thumb, placed my right forefinger straight along the arrow, and
bid me draw it by the force of the string catching on the
thumb-ring. I did so, and shot my arrow with better aim than
when pursuing the English method. His happiness was great
on my giving him a rupee for a bow, two arrows, one of which
was the poisoned one, and the thumb-ring. He said his employment
consisted principally in shooting animals at night by
laying in wait for them. He crouched down on the ground to
show the way of laying in wait for wild hogs. On seeing a
hog near, he would immediately spring to his feet and shoot his
arrow, drawing it quite to the head. Sometimes they kill hogs
with poisoned arrows; nevertheless they feed upon the animals,
taking care to cut out the flesh around the arrow the instant the
hog falls. He told us he had but one wife, his tirī, the hill-man’s
name for wife, whom he had left at home; perhaps the
tirī was an abbreviation of <i>istirī</i>, or <i>tiriyā</i>, wife.</p>

<p>After our long conversation with the savages we bade them
adieu, and my parting present was a pink silk handkerchief for
his tirī in the Hills. We returned at two <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to the boats, completely
fagged, with the accompaniment of headaches from the
heat of the sun: unmoored the vessels, and with a good breeze
reached Rajmahal at dark. During our absence some hill-men
came to the boats, and offered bows to the dāndees, begging in
exchange a piece of linen. They parted with them afterwards for
one halfpenny a piece. I must not omit to mention the magnificent
wild climber, the Cachnár, Bauhinia scandens, which I
gathered in the pass. The leaves are of immense size, heart-shaped,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
and two lobed: they collapse during the night. It is called
Bauhinia from two botanical brothers, John and Caspar Bauhin,
who, like its leaves, were separate and yet united. The Cachnár
at Allahabad is a beautiful tree, but its leaves are not so luxuriantly
large as those of the wild creeper of the Rajmahal Hills.
A cold bath and a late dinner restored me to comfortable feelings,
and thus ended my adventures, and a happy day in the
Hills of the Sikrī-galī Pass.</p>

<p>1836, <i>Dec. 4th.</i>—Early this morning Mr. S⸺ crossed the
river opposite Rajmahal, with his beaters and two little spaniels;
he killed six brace of birds, but was unable to secure more than
seven of them, from the jungly nature of the ground; the birds
are partridges of a particular sort, only found, sportsmen say,
at Rajmahal and one other place in India, the name of which I
forget. At one spot the beaters were uncertain whether they
saw a stranded boat or an alligator; it was a magar, the snub-nosed
alligator. Mr. S⸺ put a bullet into his body about
the fore-paw, the animal turned over in the river with a great
splash, beating up the mud with his tail in his agony, and disappeared
under the water. The magars are bold and fierce, the
crocodiles timid, and it is supposed they do not venture to
attack mankind; nevertheless, young children have been found
in their bodies when caught.</p>

<p>During this time I rambled over the ruins of the old palace,
which is fast falling into the river; the principal rooms still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
standing now contain a quantity of coal, the warehouse of the
steamers; it must have been a handsome building in former
days; the marble floor of the mosque remains, and a fine well.
My guide told me that at Gaur is a fine place, belonging to this
Nawāb, now in ruins. All around Rajmahal is a beautiful
jungle of magnificent bamboos; such fine clumps, interspersed
with date palm trees, overshadowing the cottages, around which
were a number of small cows, and fowls of a remarkably good
breed; every thing had an air of comfort. The walks in all
directions were so cool and pleasing, that it was very late ere I
could induce myself to return to breakfast. The inhabitants of
this pleasant jungle are accounted great thieves; an idea quite
the contrary is given from the comfortable appearance of their
cottages under the clumps of bamboos, close to the river, which
is covered with vessels passing up and down.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—The ruins of the ancient city of Gaur are laid down as
at no very great distance from the Ganges. We were very
anxious to visit the place, and therefore, quitting the Ganges,
entered the little river, the Baugruttī sotā, up which, at the
distance of half a mile, is the village of Dulalpūr: off the latter
place we moored our vessels, being unable to proceed higher up
from the shallowness of the water.</p>

<p>We explored the nālā in a dinghee, a small boat, and seeing
two wild fowl (murghābī), I requested my companion to shoot
one. “They are Brahmanī ducks, I do not like to kill them,”
he replied; I persisted; he fired, and shot the male bird, the
chakwā, it fell into the nālā, close to the boat; the hen bird,
utterly unmindful of the gun, flew round and round the dinghee,
uttering the most mournful cries over the dead body of her
mate; poor bird, with merciful cruelty we let her live;—never
again will I separate the chakwā, chakwī. The following is an
extract from Forbes’ Hindūstanī Dictionary:—“Duck (wild)
chākwī, chakaī. This is the large duck or goose, well
known in India by the name of Brahmanī <i>goose</i> or <i>duck</i>, and
in the poetry of the Hindūs, is their <i>turtle-dove</i>, for constancy
and connubial affection, with the singular circumstance of
the pair having been doomed for ever to nocturnal separation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
for having offended one of the Hindū divinities in days of yore;
whence—</p>

<p>“According to the popular belief, the male and female of
these birds are said to occupy the opposite banks of a water or
stream regularly every evening, and to exclaim the live-long night
to each other thus:—</p>

<p>The dārogha, the head man of the adjacent village, came
down to the boats to make salām, and offered me the use of two
horses for visiting Gaur; and a gentleman from the indigo
factory of Chandnī Kothī, two miles distant, had the kindness
to say he would lend me an elephant.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 6th.</i>—Early in the morning a man was seen watching
and lurking about the boats; therefore I desired the khidmatgār
to put as few spoons and forks on the breakfast-table as possible,
lest the sight of silver might bring thieves to the boats at night:
the suspicious-looking man carried in his hand a long and peculiarly
shaped brass lota, a drinking-vessel.</p>

<p>The dārogha sent the horses, and the elephant arrived, with
an invitation to our party to go to the factory, where we found
Mr. S⸺ very weak, recovering from jungle fever; but his
friend, Mr. M⸺, promised to show us the ruins. They detained
us to tiffin at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, after which, my side-saddle having
been put on one of the horses, I was ready to start; when Mr.
M⸺ recommended my going on the elephant, on account of
the deepness of the swamps we should have to pass over.
Accordingly I mounted the elephant; a number of men attended
us, amongst whom were three hill-men, with their bows and
arrows; Mr. M⸺ mounted his horse; we went on, and lost
sight of him. The factory is situated in the midst of jungle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the ground park-like around, good trees, a great number of tanks
of fine water, and a large space of morass in different directions,
filled with high jungle grass. My companion took his gun, he
is an excellent shot; nevertheless, on account of the unusual
motion on a pad, from the back of the elephant he missed his
game most strangely. We started by far too late, in spite of
which we saw eight wild boars, three hog deer, one black
partridge, two snipe, and nine or ten monkeys. Mr. M⸺ did
not join us, and we marvelled at his non-appearance. On our
return he assisted me as I descended the ladder from the back of
the kneeling elephant, and said he had been almost murdered.
He related that he quitted the house, and having gone half a
mile, was looking for us, when a man tending cows called to him,
and said, “A party on an elephant are gone that way.” Mr. M⸺
turned his horse to the point indicated, when the cowherd
struck him two blows with a stick, which almost knocked him
from his horse; as the fellow aimed the third blow, Mr. M⸺
wrenched the stick from his hand, and cut his forehead open with
a blow over the eye. The dākait, or dākū, for he was a robber
by profession, ran away; the gentleman followed. The dākait,
who had a brass vessel full of water in his hand, swung it round
most dexterously from the end of a string, not suffering the
water to escape, and sent it right at Mr. M⸺; it missed him,
and fell on the horse’s head. The robber then seized him by
the collar, and pulled him from his horse; they struggled
together, trying to throttle each other, and the dākū hit him
severely in several places; at last Mr. M⸺ made him a
prisoner, returned to the factory, and having bound his arms,
he secured him to a pillar in the verandah, tying his long hair
also to the post, to prevent his escape. We returned from the
shooting expedition just after all this had happened, and found
the ground at the man’s feet covered with blood; he appeared
to be a daring and resolute character. On being questioned as
to his motives by the gentlemen, he pretended not to understand
Hindūstanī, and to be an idiot. I went alone into the verandah:
“O, my grandmother, my grandmother! Nānī Ma, Nānī Ma,
save me!” exclaimed the man; “did I not bring you milk this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
morning?” “Yes,” said my bearer, “that is true enough; I
know the man by the peculiar shape of his brass lota; he was
lurking about the vessel, and when spoken to said he had
brought milk; the khidmatgār took it for his own use, refusing
to give me a portion.” This was the man I had observed in the
morning; he was remarkably well formed, light and active, with
muscles well developed; the beauty of his form was not hidden
by any superfluous clothing, having merely a small portion of
linen around his loins; his body was well oiled, and slippery as
an eel,—a great advantage in a personal struggle, it being scarcely
possible to retain hold on a well-oiled skin. He told me he had
been sent by an indigo-planter from the other side of the river,
to take Mr. M⸺’s life. On mentioning this to the gentlemen,
I found the men of his factory on the opposite side the river had
quarrelled about a well with the men of another factory, and in
the affray, one of Mr. M⸺’s hill-men had run the head man
of the opposite party right through the body with an arrow; it
was unknown whether it had proved fatal, and Mr. M⸺ had
crossed the river, awaiting the result of the unfortunate affair.
It was supposed the dākait had been on the watch for some time,
prowling about the place as a cowherd, and attacked the indigo-planter,
finding him alone and far from his servants, the latter
having proceeded with the party on the elephant. The robber
tending the cows was serving under the orders of the dārogha of
the village, who had lent me the horses; I was informed the
latter was a regular dākait, and was recommended to remove my
boats from the vicinity of his village, which, I understand, is
full of robbers, and close to Dulalpūr. We returned to our
boats; this most disagreeable adventure made me nervous; the
guns and pistols were looked to, that they might be in readiness
in case of attack; it was late at night, and I proposed crossing
to the other side of the Ganges; but the manjhī assured me
there was more to be feared from the violence of the stream, if
we attempted to cross the river during the darkness of the night,
than from the vicinity of the dākaits.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—We breakfasted at the factory, and then, having
mounted a fine tractable male elephant, well broken in for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
sporting, and showing very large tusks, we proceeded towards
Gaur, visiting all the ruins <i>en route</i>, and shooting from the back
of the elephant as game arose in the thick jungle and amongst
the fine trees which surrounded the tanks in every direction.
The country around one of the principal ruins is remarkably
beautiful; the ruin stands on a rising ground, covered with the
silk cotton tree, the date palm, and various other trees; and
there was a large sheet of water, covered by high jungle grass,
rising far above the heads of the men who were on foot.</p>

<p>On the clear dark purple water of a large tank floated the
lotus in the wildest luxuriance; over all the trees the jungle
climbers had twisted and twined; and the parasitical plants, with
their red flowers, were in bunches on the branches. The white
granite pillars in some parts of the ruin were erect, in others
prostrate; a number of the pillars were of black stone.</p>

<p>The Mahāwat, as we were going over this ruin, told us, “This
is the favourite resort of tigers, and in the month of Bysak they
are here in considerable number; now you may meet with one,
but it is unlikely.” My curiosity so far overcame any fear, I
could not help looking with longing eyes into the deep jungle-grass,
as we descended into and crossed the water, half-hoping,
half-fearing, to see a tiger skulking along.</p>

<p>The Sonā Masjid, or Golden Mosque, most particularly pleased
me; its vastness and solidity give the sensation one experiences in
the gloomy massive aisles of a cathedral. I will not particularly
describe the ruins, but will add a description I was allowed to
copy, written by Mr. Chambers, an indigo-planter, who, having
lived at Gaur for thirty-six years, has had the opportunity of
more particularly inspecting them than was in my power. I
brought away many of the ornamented bricks, and those glazed
with a sort of porcelain, something like Dutch tiles.</p>

<p>The gateway of the fort, with its moat below, is fine; the
ramparts are covered with large trees. Lying in a field beyond
the ramparts is a tombstone of one single block of black
marble, an enormous mass of solid marble. At 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the
khidmatgārs informed us that two chakor (perdix chukar) and a
wild duck, having been roasted in gipsy fashion under the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
dinner was ready; we seated ourselves near one of the ruins, and
partook of refreshment with infinite glee. No sooner was it
ended, than, remounting the elephant, we went to the ruins of a
hunting tower: approaching it from every point, it is a beautiful
object seen above the woods, or through the intervals between
the trees. Akbar beautified the city, and may probably have
built this circular tower,—a column of solid masonry, within
which winds a circular stair. At Fathīpūr Sicrī is a tower,
somewhat of a similar description, built by Akbar, and used as
a hunting tower; people were sent forth to drive the game from
every part towards the minār, from the top of which the emperor
massacred his game at leisure. This tower at Gaur, much more
beautifully situated, with a greater command of country, may
have been used for a similar purpose. The building is on a
larger scale, and much handsomer than the one at Fathīpūr Sicrī.</p>

<p>My companion mounted the hunting tower; climbing up the
broken stones, a feat of some difficulty, he went up to the dome,
which is now in ruins, though its egg shape may be clearly traced.
The view pleased him: he was anxious I should ascend; but I was
deterred by the difficulty of climbing up to the entrance porch,
which is of carved black stone and very handsome.</p>

<p>There is one thing to observe with relation to the buildings:
judging from the exterior ornaments on the stones, they would
be pronounced Muhammadan; but, on taking out the stones, the
other side presents Hindoo images; as if the conquerors had
just turned and ornamented the stones according to their own
fashion. The Hindoo idols around Gaur have generally been
broken; the interior of the buildings, presenting pillars of
massive stone, appear to me Hindoo: this point I leave to the
learned, and rest content myself with admiring their fallen
grandeur. The peepul tree and the banyan spring from the
crevices, twisting their roots between the masses of stone,
destroying the buildings with great rapidity; the effect, nevertheless,
is so picturesque, one cannot wish the foliage to be
destroyed. Crossing a bridge, we saw what I supposed to be
the dry trunk of a tree; it was a large alligator asleep on the
edge of a morass. Mr. S⸺ fired, the ball struck him just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
below the shoulders, and from the paralyzed appearance of the
animal must have entered the spine; he opened his enormous
jaws and uttered a cry of agony. A second bullet missed him;
he made an effort, and slipped over into the water, which became
deeply dyed with his blood. Every tank is full of alligators.
He sank to the bottom, and the dāndees lost a meal, by them
considered very agreeable. I roamed on the elephant until it
was very dark, when I got into the palanquin; one of the party
rode by its side, and amused himself by catching fire-flies in
his hand, and throwing them into the palkee. How beautifully
the fire-flies flitted about over the high jungle grass that covered
the morasses! As they crossed before the dark foliage of the
trees, they were seen in peculiar brilliancy.</p>

<p>In the jungle, I saw several pān gardens, carefully covered
over. Pān (piper betel), a species of pepper plant, is cultivated
for its leaves; the vine itself is perennial, creeping, very long,
and rooting at all the joints; the leaves have an aromatic scent
and pungent taste. In India, of which it is a native, it is protected
from the effect of the weather by screens made of bamboo.
The root of the pān, called khoolinjān, as a medicine, is held in
high estimation, and is considered an antidote to poison.</p>

<p>In one of the buildings you are shown the kadam sharīf, or
the prints of the honoured feet of the prophet; over which
is a silken canopy. The door is always fastened, and a pious
Musalmān claps his hands three times, and utters some holy
words ere he ventures to cross the threshold. This ceremony
omitted, is, they say, certain and instantaneous death to the
impious wretch: but this penalty only attaches itself to the
followers of the prophet, as we found no ill effect from the
omission. In the Qanoon-e-islam the history of the kadam-i-rasūl,
the footstep of the prophet, is said to be as follows: “As
the prophet (the peace and blessing of God be with him!), after
the battle of Ohud (one of the forty or fifty battles in which the
prophet had been personally engaged), was one day ascending a
hill, in a rage, by the heat of his passion the mountain softened
into the consistence of wax, and retained, some say eighteen,
others forty impressions of his feet. When the angel Gabriel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
(peace be unto him!) brought the divine revelation that it did
not become him to get angry, the prophet (the peace! &amp;c.)
inquired what was the cause of this rebuke. Gabriel replied,
‘Look behind you for a moment and behold.’ His excellency,
when he perceived the impressions of his feet on the stones,
became greatly astonished, and his wrath immediately ceased.
Some people have these very impressions, while others make
artificial ones to imitate them. Some people keep a qudum-e-russool,
footstep of the prophet, or the impression of a foot on
stone in their houses, placed in a box, and covered with a
<i>mahtabee</i> or <i>tagtee</i> covering; and this, they say, is the impression
of the foot of the prophet (the peace! &amp;c.).</p>

<p>“On this day (the bara-wufât) such places are elegantly decorated.
Having covered the chest with <i>moqeish</i> and zurbaft,
they place the qudum-e-moobarik (blessed foot) on it, or
deposit it in a <i>taboot</i>; and place all round it beautiful <i>moorch’huls</i>
or <i>chawn-urs</i>; and as at the <i>Mohurrum</i> festival, so now,
they illuminate the house, have music, burn frankincense, wave
<i>moorch’huls</i> over it. Five or six persons, in the manner of a
song or <i>murseea</i>, repeat the <i>mowlood</i>, <i>dorood Qoran</i>, his <i>mowjeezay</i>
(or miracles), and <i>wafat nama</i> (or the history of his death);
the latter in Hindostanee, in order that the populace may
comprehend it, and feel for him sympathy and sorrow.”</p>

<p>Some Muhammadan tombs are also shown here: the place is
embowered in fine trees, on the branches of which are hundreds
of monkeys flinging themselves from branch to branch in every
direction. The fakīr in charge of the kadam-i-mubārak, the
blessed foot, asked alms; which I promised to bestow, if he
would bring me some of the old rupees, or any coin dug up in
Gaur. Coins in great numbers are continually found, but the
poor people are afraid of showing any treasure in their possession,
for fear of being made to give it up to the Company. I
was unable to procure any; still I hope, through my friends at
the factory, to get a few. The silver coins are very large and
thin. A curiosity of carved sandal-wood was shown in the
building of the Kadam Sharīf: its name I forget.</p>

<p>After this long day spent in exploring the ruins, we stopped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
at the factory. Mr. S⸺ blamed us highly for having remained
so late in the jungle, on account of the fever, so likely
to be caught after sunset. With him we found Mr. Chambers,
also an indigo-planter, who gave me a specimen taken out of a
casowtee stone. In boring the stone for some water in the
factory, a portion, which appeared to consist of gold and
silver, incorporated with the stone, fell out. The casowtee
stone is esteemed very valuable; its colour is black: this
was dug up in the Rakabud Mosque at Gaur. Having thanked
our new acquaintances for their great attention and hospitality,
we returned to the boats. I was much over-fatigued, and ached
in every limb from the motion of the elephant, one accounted
exceedingly rough. The former night the fear of robbery had
rendered me sleepless; that night I was so much fatigued, a
dākait would have had hard work to awaken me.</p>

<p>The country around Gaur is very open, interspersed with
innumerable fine tanks, surrounded by large trees. The fields
present one sheet of golden colour in every direction; the sarson
was in full flower, its yellow flowers looking so gay amidst the
trees, the old ruins, and the sheets of water. The sarson (sinapis
dichotoma) is one of the species of mustard plant cultivated
in Bengal in great quantities on account of the oil extracted
from the seeds, which is used for burning in lamps and in
Hindustanī cookery. The bricks of which the buildings are
composed are very small and thin, very strongly burned, and
very heavy, united with lime alone, no mortar having been
used with it, which accounts for the durability of the ruins, and
the great difficulty of detaching a brick from any part, so firm is
the cement.</p>

<p>I am told the tanks are full of alligators; the crocodile is in
the Ganges, but not in the tanks at Gaur; and these fierce
snub-nosed alligators in some tanks are quite tame, coming up
at the call of the fakīrs, and taking the offerings of living kids
from their hands: cattle are often seized and devoured by them.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—I awoke much too weary to attempt hog-hunting,
although the elephants were attired on the bank. Close to, and
on the right of Dulalpūr, hares, black partridge, and peacocks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
were numerous. In the marshes were wild hogs in droves of
from two to three hundred; and little pigs squeaking and running
about were seen with several of the droves.</p>

<p>The gentleman who went out on the elephant returned,
bringing with him two large wild boars and a young hog. We
had the tusks extracted, and gave the meat to the servants, I
being too much a Musalmanī myself to eat hogs’ flesh of any
sort or description. The Rajpūts will eat the flesh of the wild
boar, although they abhor the flesh of domesticated swine.</p>

<p>Mr. Chambers came down to the river, where he had eight
boats containing indigo to the value of two lakh. He showed
me some fine old casowtee stones covered with Hindoo images,
dug up in Gaur, and gave me some specimens of the Gaur
bricks; the stones he is sending home to the owner of the
factory, Lord Glenelg. From the hill-men in charge of the
indigo boats, I procured what is used by them as a salt-box, and
was of their own making; merely one joint of a thick bamboo
curiously carved and painted, in the hollow of which they
carry their salt. They gave me also an arrow for bruising,
with a head of iron like a bullet. Thus ended a most interesting
visit; and to this account I will add Mr. Chambers’ description
of the place, copied from his manuscript.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“THE RUINS OF GAUR.</p>

<p>“The ancient city of Gaur, said to have been the capital of
Bengal, seven hundred and fifty years before the commencement
of the Christian era, is now an uninhabited waste. It is situated
on the east side of the Ganges, and runs nearly in a direction
with it from <span class="allsmcap">S.E.</span> to <span class="allsmcap">N.N.W.</span>, about twenty-five miles below Rajmahal.
It lies in N. lat. 24° 53′, and in E. long. 88° 14′, and
is supposed by Rennell to be the Gangia regia of Ptolemy. It
has borne various names; it was formerly called Lutchmavutee
or Lucknowtee, as well as Gaur; and when repaired and beautified
in 1575, by the great Akbar, who is said to have been particularly
attached to this city, it received from him the name of
Zennuttabad, from his fancying it a kind of terrestrial Paradise.
The extent of the city appears, from the old embankments which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
enclosed it on every side, to have been ten miles long and two
miles broad. These banks were sufficiently capable of guarding
it from floods during the rising of the Ganges, when the rest of
the country was inundated, as well as defending the place from
an enemy, as there are mounds of earth from thirty to forty
feet in height, and from one to two hundred feet broad at
the base, the removal of the earth forming deep broad ditches
on the outside of the banks. Some of these embankments
were defended by brickwork. On the outside, the city has two
embankments two hundred feet wide, running parallel to each
other, at five hundred and eighty feet asunder, probably for
greater security against a large lake to the eastward, which in
strong weather drives with great violence against it during the
season of the inundations. The principal passes through these
banks to the city had gateways, two of which, one at the south
end, and the other at the north end, are still standing, and the
remains of others that have been destroyed are visible. The
suburbs extended (there being sufficient vestiges of them to be
traced) at least to a distance of four miles from each of those
gates. Two grand roads led through the whole length of the
city, raised with earth and paved with bricks, terminating with
the gate at the south end. Where drains and canals intersected
the roads, are the remains of bridges built over them.</p>

<p>“The buildings and mosques must have been very numerous;
the rubbish and stones of which still left, point out the places
where they stood. The two called golden mosques, and the
Nuttee Musjeed, are doubtless the best buildings of that kind.</p>

<p>“In the midst of the city stood a fort, nearly square, and extending
about a mile on every side, which had a bank or rampart
forty feet high: there is a wall now remaining nearly a quarter
of a mile in extent, and in some places between seventy and
eighty feet in height, which surrounds a space many feet long
and wide, parted into three divisions, and is supposed to have
surrounded the king’s palace. The gates leading to the fort,
and another to Shah Husain’s tomb are partly left, but covered
with trees, and as full of bats and reptiles as the ditches are of
alligators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>“The whole of this extensive boundary, including the fort
and city, contains innumerable tanks and ponds of various sizes.
The Saugur-dighee tank is a mile in length, by half a mile in
breadth; three or four others, with this, are the best and largest
cisterns of water in the place.</p>

<p>“At one of the tanks the Musselmāns make offerings to the
alligators, which has made them so tame, they come to the
shore and take away what is offered.</p>

<p>“The following observations on the ruins which still remain
sufficiently entire, commence with the great</p>

<p class="center">“GOLDEN MOSQUE.</p>

<p>“This noble building appears to stand nearly in the centre
of this ancient capital. It is built of brick, but is ornamented
on all sides with a kind of black porphyry stone. This mosque
appears to have been surrounded with a wall, which, on the east
side of the building, formed a court about three hundred feet in
length and two hundred and fifty in breadth. The mosque itself
formed a building one hundred and seventy feet in length from
north to south, and one hundred and thirty in breadth. These
dimensions are easily ascertained, as the north and south doors
of the mosque, which mark its length, remain entire, and the
breadth is easily computed from the one range and the ruins of
the rest which yet remain. Its height within is about sixty feet,
but it is probable that the spires of its lofty domes rose to the
height of one hundred feet from the ground. Its internal structure
presents a singular appearance. Its breadth is divided into
six ranges resembling the aisles of a church. These aisles are
in breadth twelve feet; and as they extend the whole length of
the building from north to south, they are somewhat better than
a hundred and fifty feet in length.</p>

<p>“The six walls which once divided them and supported the
roof were eight feet in thickness, built of brick, and covered
with black porphyry to a considerable height. These ranges of
aisles are not formed of solid masonry; each of them is intersected
by eleven openings from east to west, of somewhat more
than six feet in breadth. This, in reality, divided the wall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
which supports the roof of each range into twelve massy
columns of eight feet square, so that the whole building contained
seventy-two of these columns, eight feet both in length
and breadth, of which the six outer ones on the two sides north
and south adhering to the outside wall, left sixty within to support
the roof. These rows of columns closed over each aisle,
and thus formed six semicircular roofs, covering and extending
the whole length of each aisle. It was, however, only that part
furnished by each column which formed the arches of these six
semicircular roofs; the eleven spaces which intersect each
range, were formed above into domes about eleven feet in diameter
within, and terminating in a point without. Of these
six ranges or aisles, only one, that on the east side, is now entire,
although traces of the other five are still visible. Of the domes
in this range, the roofs of five are entire; those of two more are
merely open at the top; in three more the roof has entirely
fallen in; and the roofs on the rest having half fallen, seem to
threaten the spectator with instant destruction, should any part
of the mouldering ruin fall whilst he is walking underneath.</p>

<p>“The outward walls are nine feet in thickness. They are
built of small bricks, extremely hard, and with excellent cement.
The whole building seems to have suffered far less from depredation
than from the numerous shrubs and trees which grow
upon it, and which, insinuating their roots into the breaches
of the walls, threaten the whole with unavoidable and speedy
dissolution.</p>

<p>“Proceeding about a mile distant from the above-mentioned
mosque, there is a large</p>

<p class="center">“OBELISK,</p>

<p class="noindent">“which stands alone, completely separate from any other
building. It is supposed to have been erected for an observatory,
or for the sake of calling the inhabitants to the regular
performance of their daily devotions. It contains four stories, with
a staircase within. The first story, about twelve feet from the
ground, must be entered by a ladder. The wall is marked by
many small windows placed over each other in a perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
line. The top is now completely open, but appears to have
been formerly surmounted by a dome. On the wall within is
discerned the vestiges of numerous former visitors, and their
initials cut in the stones with the date annexed. Many of these
names were identified: directing attention to the most ancient, to
discover, if possible, how long this has been the resort of European
visitors, we traced ‘W. Harwood, April 17th, 1771;’ ‘G. Grey,
1772;’ ‘I. Henchman;’ ‘G. W.;’ ‘H. C.;’ and many others:
inspecting more narrowly the initials ‘M. V., 1683,’ are deciphered.
This was the remotest date ascertained: this reaches
into the middle of the famous Aurunzebe’s reign, and it may
easily be supposed that the place had fallen into decay at least a
hundred and eighty years, if not more. Who this European traveller
could have been is a matter of conjecture; but it is agreed
that he was some gentleman from Holland or Portugal. This
date, if Gaur had fallen into decay previous to his visit, might
ascertain the time of its having been abandoned.</p>

<p>“If the Emperor of Delhi, Akbar, who was contemporary
with our Elizabeth, repaired and beautified it, the period between
this visit and the meridian glory of Gaur could not have been
more than ninety years.</p>

<p>“The height of the upper story from the ground is seventy-one
feet. When to this is added the height of the cupola, &amp;c.,
it seems probable that one hundred feet was the original height
of the building. The diameter of the area in the upper story is
precisely ten feet: as the extreme diameter at the bottom is only
twenty-one feet, if the thickness of the two walls is reckoned
at about three and a half, the extreme diameter of the upper
story will be seventeen feet, so that in a height of seventy
feet, its diameter has lessened little more than three feet, a circumstance
which reflects the highest credit both on the architect
and the materials of the building, as it has resisted the
strongest hurricanes for so many hundred years. The steps of
the staircase, which remain entire, are about fifty, but in many
instances the intermediate ones are worn away. The windows
are formed of black porphyry, which appears to have been
intended for support as well as ornament, as the stones about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
two feet in length and one in breadth, and nearly a foot in
thickness, support each other by means of tenons formed in the
stone itself; and they, in several instances, stand firm, although
the brickwork has fallen from them, whilst they are really
firm; however, they assume so threatening an aspect from their
appearing loose, that the visitor is almost afraid of being crushed
beneath them.</p>

<p>“To the southward, about half a mile beyond the obelisk,
is the</p>

<p class="center">“NUTTEE MUSJEED,</p>

<p class="noindent">“by some Europeans termed the China mosque, from the bricks
of which it is built being ornamented with various colours. This
building, however, has nothing of the mosque beyond some
little resemblance in its external appearance, nor is there any
thing within it corresponding with the internal appearance of the
great Golden Mosque; it appears evidently intended for purposes
of amusement. It is the most entire of any structure now
remaining at Gaur. Its extreme length from east to west is
about seventy-two feet, its breadth about fifty-four feet, and its
height about seventy feet. The outer walls, nine feet in thickness,
are formed of bricks, extremely small, not exceeding four
inches in length, three in breadth, and one inch and a half in
thickness; but these bricks are so well made, and the cement is
so firm, that the building has almost the solidity of stone. The
surface of these bricks is painted and glazed, yellow, white,
green, and blue in alternate succession; and the whole appears
to have been finished with a neatness approaching to finery.
The east, the north, and the south sides have three doors,
forming nine in the whole; on the west side it is closed. The
arch of the middle door on each side is about eleven feet in
height, the other two about nine feet high. The breadth is
somewhat about six feet. On entering the east door, a partition
wall presents itself, forming a space twelve feet in extent,
and the whole breadth of the building. This marks the east as
having been the front entrance, as this formed a kind of porch
to the vestibule, in which probably servants remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“The space within this forms a beautiful room, about thirty-six
feet square, the four walls closing above, and forming a majestic
dome. The height of this spacious room we had no means of
ascertaining exactly, but, from its appearance, it may be from
forty to fifty feet. So spacious and lofty a room, without a
pillar, beam, or rafter, is a real curiosity; and when the antiquity
of the building, the smallness of the bricks which compose it,
and its present high state of preservation are considered, it seems
evident that the art of building, as far as durability is considered,
was far better understood in Bengal formerly than is
indicated now by any modern edifice in the metropolis of India.
Are European science and skill completely distanced by the
former knowledge of a nation deemed only half-civilized?</p>

<p class="center">“THE SOUTH GATE</p>

<p class="noindent">formed the southern boundary of the city; its majestic arch still
remains, it is thirty-five feet wide; on each side is a piece of
masonry sixty feet square, and in height nearly equal to the
outside of the arch surmounting the gateway, which is somewhat
better than sixty feet. The masonry is united both on
the east and west side by a rampart of earth, which is also
sixty feet high, and is covered with trees of various kinds.
This rampart, however, would have formed but a feeble defence
against an army of Europeans, whatever it might have been
esteemed against an Indian army.</p>

<p>“Many mosques, and the remains of old buildings, as well as a
great number of fine stone pillars which once supported splendid
edifices, are to be seen entangled by jungle and high grass, completely
covered up in some places, and in other places prostrate,
the foundations having been excavated for bricks and stones.
The towns of Malda, Rajmahal, and Moorshadabad have been
supplied with building materials from Gaur, which to this day
are continually carried to the populous adjacent towns and
villages, to build native dwellings.</p>

<p>“In passing through so large an extent of that which was once
a scene of human grandeur, nothing presents itself but these
few remains; trees and grass now fill up the space, giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
shelter to a variety of wild creatures; buffaloes, deer, wild hogs,
monkeys, peacocks, and the common fowl, now become wild;
the roar of the tiger, the cry of the peacock, the howls of the
jackals, with the company of bats and troublesome insects,
soon become familiar to those inhabiting the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>1836, <i>Dec. 9th.</i>—Arrived at Jungipūr, where a toll was levied
of six rupees on my bajrā, usually called budjerow, and two rupees
on the cook boat,—a tax for keeping open a deep channel in the
river. During the hour we anchored there, and the servants were
on shore for provisions, I was much amused watching the women
bathing; they wade into the stream, wash their dresses, and put
them on again all wet, as they stand in the water; wash their
hair and their bodies, retaining all the time some part of their
drapery, which assumes the most classical appearance. They wear
their hair fastened behind in the Grecian fashion, large silver
nose-rings, a great number of white ivory churees (bracelets) on
their arms, with a pair of very large silver bangles on the wrists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and massive ornaments of silver on their ankles; their drapery
white, with, perhaps, an edge of some gay colour; bright brass
vessels for water (gāgrī), or of porous red earthenware (gharā),
in which they carry back the river water to their dwellings.
Having bathed, they repeat their prayers, with their hands palm
to palm raised to their faces, and turning in pooja to particular
points. After sipping the water a certain number of times,
taking it up in their hands, they trip away in their wet drapery,
which dries as they walk. The skin of the women in Bengal is
of a better tinge than that of the up-country women; they are
small, well-formed, and particularly graceful in their movements.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—The Bhaugruttī, as you approach Moorshadabad, is
remarkably picturesque, and presents a thousand views that
would make beautiful sketches. At this moment we are passing
the Nawāb’s residence, or rather the palace that is building for
him; it is situated on the side of the river, which presents
a beautiful expanse of water, covered with vessels of all sorts
and sizes, of the most oriental and picturesque form. A fine
breeze is blowing, and the vessels on every side, and all around
me, are in every sort of picturesque and beautiful position.
The palace, which is almost quite completed, is a noble building,
an enormous and grand mass of architecture, reared under the
superintendence of Colonel Macleod.</p>

<p>The mor-pankhī, a kind of pleasure boat, with the long neck
and head of a peacock, most richly gilt and painted, and the
snake boats, used on days of festival, are fairy-like, picturesque,
fanciful, and very singular. Pinnaces for hire are here in numbers.
The merchant-boats built at this place are of peculiar and beautiful
form, as if the builder had studied both effect and swiftness;
the small boats, over which rafts are fastened to float down
wood; the fishermen’s little vessels, that appear almost too
small and fragile to support the men, and which fly along impelled
only by one oar; the well-wooded banks, the mosques,
and the mut’hs (Hindoo temples), mixed with curiously built
native houses;—all unite in forming a scene of peculiar beauty.
Kasīm bazār adjoins Moorshadabad; both are famous for silk of
every sort. In the evening we anchored at Berhampūr; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
budgerow was instantly crowded with people, bringing carved
ivory toys, chess-men, elephants, &amp;c., for sale, and silk merchants,
with handkerchiefs and Berhampūr silk in abundance;
all asking more than double the price they intended to take.
Four more dāndees having deserted, I have been obliged to apply
to the Judge Sāhib to procure other men.</p>

<p>The most delicious oranges have been procured here, the
rinds fine and thin, the flavour excellent; the natives call them
“cintra;” most likely they were introduced by the Portuguese.
The station extends along the side of the river, which is well
banked, and offers a cool and refreshing evening walk to the
residents. I was tempted to buy some of the carved ivory
chess-men, an elephant, &amp;c., all very cheap, and well carved in
good ivory; nor could I resist some silk nets for the horses.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—At Cutwa cotton cloth was offered for sale; I bought
some, but the purchase gave more trouble than the cloth
was worth. The men asked eighteen sicca-rupees for each
piece of eighteen yards, and took eleven Furrukhabad rupees;
the mosquito curtains, for which they asked five rupees each,
they sold for three.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—Arrived at Culna, to which place the tide comes up.
Here we anchored, to buy charcoal and clarified butter for my own
consumption, and rice for the dāndees. We have passed a great
many timber rafts that are floating down to Calcutta, with
wood, for sale; the timber is cut in the hills. The stems of
two large trees are lashed across a boat, and, passing over the
sides to a considerable distance, support a number of trees,
which float on the water, fastened along both sides of the boat;
on the boat itself is a thatched shed. On each raft are two
hill-men, their black bodies and heads completely shaved; with
no clothing but a bit of cloth passed between the limbs, and
supported by a string tied round the waist. They have a wild
look as they row with their bamboo oars the unwieldy rafts,
three or four of which are fastened together;—a picture in itself
is the wild and strange-looking timber raft. A small canoe,
hollowed out of a single tree, is always the accompaniment to
a raft; I saw four men in a canoe of this sort crossing the river;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
one man steered by using an oar, while the other three, by
leaning forward, made use of their hands alone as paddles; you
may therefore imagine how narrow the boat was, when a man
could use a hand at each side at the same time in the water, to
paddle her forward. The men were laughing and shouting most
happily. They cut the timber in the hills, and come down
with it for scarcely any payment, merely just enough to feed
them.</p>

<p>When the boats have delivered their wood in Calcutta, they
take up one boat, and put it into another, and in this way the
double boats return to the hills; for this reason two men alone
come with one boat down the stream, but in returning, more
men are required to track against it; the two boats being put
one on the other, the four men suffice to take them back
again.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—This evening we anchored at Chandar-nagar, the town
of Chandar, <i>the moon</i>, commonly called Chander-nagore, and
took a walk to see a Bengālee temple, which looked well
from the river. The building consisted of a temple in the
centre, containing an image of the goddess Kalī, and five
smaller temples on each side, each containing an image of
Mahadēo; a little further on were two images, gaily dressed in
tarnished silk and tinsel; the one a female figure, Unapurna,
the other Mahadēo, as a Bairāgī or religious mendicant. The
village was pretty. I stopped at a fisherman’s, to look at the
curiously-shaped floats he used for his very large and heavy
fishing nets; each float was formed of eight pieces of sholā,
tied together by the ends, the four smaller within the four
larger. When this light and spongy pith is wetted, it can be
cut into thin layers, which, pasted together, are formed into
hats; Chinese paper appears to be made of the same material.
The banks of the river, the whole distance from Hoogly to
Chinsurah and Chandar-nagar, presents a view of fine houses,
situated in good gardens, and interspersed with the dwellings of
the natives. There is a church at Chandar-nagar, where there are
also cantonments; and the grand depôt for the wood from the
up-country rafts appears to be at this place; the river-side was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
completely covered with timber for some distance. The natives
were amusing themselves as we passed, sending up small fire
balloons, and brilliantly blue sky rockets.</p>

<p>The view is beautiful at Barrackpūr; the fine trees of the
park stretching along the side of the river; the bright green
turf that slopes gently down to the water; the number of
handsome houses, with their lawns and gardens; the Government-house
and the buildings around it, stuccoed to resemble
white stone; the handsome verandahs which surround the
houses, supported by pillars; and the great number of boats
gliding about, render it peculiarly pleasing.</p>

<p>In front, on the opposite side of the river, is the Danish
settlement of Serampūr; its houses, which are large and handsome,
are two or three stories high. We are floating gently
down with the tide; I can scarcely write, the scenery attracts
me so much,—the Bengālee mandaps (places of worship) close
to the water, the fine trees of every description, and the pretty
stone ghāts. We have just passed a ruined ghāt, situated in the
midst of fine old trees; at the top of the flight of steps are the
ruins of two Hindoo temples of picturesque form; an old
peepul tree overshadows them; its twisted roots are exposed,
the earth having been washed away during the rains. A number
of women are bathing, others carrying water away in gharās
poised on their heads: the men take it away in water vessels,
which are hung to either end of a split bamboo, called a
bahangī, which is carried balanced on the shoulder. We fly
past the objects with the ebbing tide; what an infinity of beauty
there is in all the native boats! could my pencil do justice to
the scenery, how valuable would be my sketch-book!</p>

<p>The Governor-General, Lord Auckland, lives partly in Calcutta,
and partly at the Government-house at Barrackpūr. At Cassipūr
is the house of the agent for gunpowder, its white pillars
half-hidden by fine trees. At Chitpore is a high, red, Birmingham-looking,
long-chimnied building, with another in the same
style near it; the high chimneys of the latter emitting a dark
volume of smoke, such as one only sees in this country pouring
from the black funnel of a steamer: corn is here ground in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the English fashion, and oil extracted from divers seeds. The
establishment cost a great sum of money, and I think I have
heard it has failed, owing to each native family in India grinding
their own corn, in the old original fashion of one flat circular
mill-stone over another, called a chakkī.</p>

<p>From this point I first caught a view of the shipping off
Calcutta: for ten years I had not beheld an English vessel:
how it made me long for a glimpse of all the dear ones in
England! “The desire of the garden never leaves the heart of
the nightingale<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.”</p>

<p>Passing through the different vessels that crowd the Hoogly
off Calcutta, gave me great pleasure; the fine merchant-ships,
the gay, well-trimmed American vessels, the grotesque forms of
the Arab ships, the Chinese vessels with an eye on each side
the bows to enable the vessel to see her way across the deep
waters, the native vessels in all their fanciful and picturesque
forms, the pleasure-boats of private gentlemen, the beautiful
private residences in Chowringhee, the Government-house, the
crowds of people, and vehicles of all descriptions, both European
and Asiatic,—form a scene of beauty of which I know not the
equal.</p>

<p>We anchored at Chandpaul ghāt, amidst a crowd of vessels.
The river-beggars fly about in the very smallest little boats in
the world, paddled by one tiny oar: a little flag is stuck up in
the boat, and on a mat at the bottom, spread to receive offerings,
is a collection of copper coins, rice and cowries, thrown by the
pious or the charitable to these fakīrs; who, if fame belie them
not, are rascals. “A gooroo at home, but a beggar abroad<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.”
I forgive them the sin of rascality, for their picturesque appearance;
the gifts they received were very humble. “A kuoree
is a gold mohur to a pauper<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.”</p>

<p>There not being room that night for our party at Spence’s
hotel, I was forced to sleep on board the budjerow, off Chandpaul
ghāt. What a wretched night it was! The heat was
intolerable. I could not open a window because the budjerows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
on either side were jammed against mine: the heat, the noise,
the mooring and unmooring, according to the state of the tide,
rendered it miserable work. I wished to anchor lower down,
but the answer was, “Budjerows must anchor here; it is the
Lord Sāhib’s hukm (order).”</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—I took possession of apartments in Spence’s hotel:
they were good and well furnished. Since I quitted Calcutta, a
great improvement has taken place: a road has been opened
from the Government-house to Garden Reach, by the side of
the river; the drive is well watered, the esplanade crowded with
carriages, and the view of the shipping beautiful.</p>

<p>M. le Général Allard, who had just returned from France,
and was in Calcutta <i>en route</i> to rejoin Runjeet Singh, called on
me; he is the most picturesque person imaginable; his long
forked beard, divided in the centre, hangs down on either side
his face; at dinner-time he passes one end of his beard over
one ear, and the other end over the other ear. The General, who
was a most agreeable person, regretted he had not seen me when
he passed Allahabad, but illness had prevented his calling and
delivering, in person, the bows and arrows entrusted to his charge.</p>

<p>I was much delighted with the General: he asked me to visit
Lahore, an invitation I told him I would accept with great
pleasure, should I ever visit the Hills, and he promised to send
an escort for me. The General took with him to Europe some
fine jewels, emeralds, and other valuable stones; he brought
them back to India, as they were of less value in Europe than
in the East.</p>

<p>I could have remained contentedly at the hotel myself, but
my up-country servants complained there was no comfort
for them; therefore I took a small house in Chowringhee, and
removed into it the furniture from the budjerow. It was comfortable
also to have my horses, which had arrived, in the
stables.</p>

<p>Went to a ball given in the English style by a rich Bengālee
Baboo, Rustam-jee Cowsajee. The Misses Eden were there,
which the Baboo ought to have thought a very great honour.</p>

<p>1837, <i>Jan. 1st.</i>—Mr. H⸺ arrived from Assam, suffering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
from the effects of one of the terrific fevers of that country:
he brought me a <i>leaf insect</i>,—a great curiosity.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—Made my salām at the Government-house, as in duty
bound.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—The first day of the races: drove to the stand at
seven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, through a deep, white, thick fog, so usual in the
early morning in Calcutta, which did my sore throat and cold
no good.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—The second day of the races; the Auckland Cup was
to be given to the winner. The cup was of silver, the design
remarkable, and very beautiful. It was sketched by Miss Eden,
and executed in good style by Messrs. Pittar and Co., jewellers,
in Calcutta. The winning horse came in well: twenty yards
beyond the post, as the jockey attempted to pull him up, the
horse dropped and died instantly. The cup was awarded to the
dead horse. It was a piteous sight.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—Accompanied Mr. W⸺ and a party over his racing
stables: the sight of the racers all ready for the contest in the
morning was pleasing. We then visited a number of imported
English and Cape horses that were for sale.</p>

<p>In the evening I drove to see the far-famed Bengālee idol,
Kalī Mā’ī, to which, in former times, human sacrifices were
publicly offered; and to which, in the present day, and in spite
of the vigilance of the magistrate, I believe, at times, a human
being is offered up;—some poor wretch who has no one likely
to make inquiries about him. The temple is at Kalī Ghāt,
about two miles from Calcutta. The idol is a great black stone
cut into the figure of an enormous woman, with a large head
and staring eyes; her tongue hangs out of her mouth, a great
broad tongue, down to her breast. The figure is disgusting. I
gave the attendant priests a rupee for having shown me their
idol, which they offered with all reverence to Kalī Mā’ī. The
instruments with which, at one stroke, the priest severs the
head of the victim from the trunk are remarkable.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—A cup of silver, given by a rich Bengālee, Dwarkanath
Tagore, was run for: the cup was elaborately worked, and the
workmanship good; but the design was in the excess of bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
taste, and such as only a Baboo would have approved. It was
won by Absentee, one of the horses I had seen in the stable the
day before, contrary to the calculation of all the knowing ones
in Calcutta.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—The inhabitants of Calcutta gave a ball to the Miss
Edens. I was too ill to attend.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—Dined with an old friend at Alipūr, some two miles
from Calcutta. The coachman being unable to see his way
across the maidān (plain), stopped. The sā’īses, who were
trying to find out where they were, ran directly against the walls
of the hospital; the fog was so dense and white, you could not
see a yard before you; it made my cough most painful, and the
carriage was two hours returning two miles.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 4th.</i>—I spent the day at the Asiatic Society. A model
of the foot of a Chinese lady in the collection is a curiosity, and
a most disgusting deformity. The toes are crushed up under
the foot, so as to render the person perfectly lame: this is a
less expensive mode of keeping a woman confined to the house,
than having guards and a zenāna—the principle is the same.</p>

<p>Having bid adieu to my friends in Calcutta, I prepared to
return to Allahabad, and took a passage in the Jellinghy flat.
The servants went up the river in a large baggage boat, with the
stores, wine, and furniture. I did not insure the boat, insurance
being very high, and the time of the year favourable. The
horses marched up the country.</p>

<p><i>March 6th.</i>—I went on board the Jellinghy flat, established
myself and my ayha in a good cabin, and found myself, for the
first time, located in a steamer. She quitted Calcutta in the
evening, and as we passed Garden Reach, the view of handsome
houses in well-wooded grounds, which extend along the banks of
the river, was beautiful. The water being too shallow at this
time of the year for the passage of the steamer up the Bhaugruttī,
or the Jellinghy, she was obliged to go round by the sunderbands
(sindhū-bandh). The steamer herself is not the vessel in which
the passengers live; attached to, and towed by her, is a vessel as
large as the steamer herself, called a flat, built expressly to
convey passengers and Government treasure. It is divided into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
cabins, with one large cabin in the centre, in which the passengers
dine together.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—We quitted the Hoogly and anchored in the sunderbands.
The sunderbands is a large tract of low muddy land,
covered with short thick jungle and dwarf trees. It is an assemblage
of islands, the tides flowing between them. A more
solitary desolate tract I never beheld. We anchored where
three streams met, flowing in from between these low mud
islands. When the tide turned in the middle of the night, the
steamer swung round on the flat with a crash; several times
the two vessels were entangled in this manner; the steamer
drove in one of the cabin windows, and it was some time ere
every thing was right again. Exposed to the power of the
three streams, she was never quiet, never at rest: the children
cried, the ducks did not like to be killed, and the vessels were
wrestling together for hours—an unquiet night.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—The mud islands are under water at high tide. At this
moment we are passing through a very narrow passage; on
each side the thick, low, impenetrable jungle comes down to
the water’s edge. Not a tree of any size to be seen; not a
vessel, not an animal. During the whole of this day I have
only seen two paddy birds, and one deer. The thick jungle is
full of tigers; so much so, that the Hindoos on board are not
allowed to go on shore to cook their food on that account.
Going along with the tide in our favour, the swiftness of the
steamer is terrific; the velocity with which we pass the banks
makes me giddy. We have just passed a spot on which an oar
is stuck up on end. The captain of the flat pointed it out to
me as a sign that a native had been carried off at that spot by a
tiger. It is the custom to leave an oar to point out the spot,
or to stick up a bamboo with a flag attached to it—as in
Catholic countries a cross is erected on the spot where a murder
has been committed.</p>

<p>“Kaloo-rayŭ is a form of Shivŭ: the image is that of a yellow
man sitting on a tiger, holding in his right hand an arrow, and
in his left a bow. A few of the lower orders set up clay images
of this god, in straw houses, and worship them at pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
The wood-cutters in the eastern, western, and southern forests
of Bengal, in order to obtain protection from wild beasts, adopt
a peculiar mode of worshipping this idol. The head boatman
raises elevations of earth, three or four inches high, and about
three feet square, upon which he places balls of clay, painted
red; and, amongst other ceremonies, offers rice, flowers, fruits,
and the water of the Ganges carried from the river Hoogly,
keeping a fast: the god then directs him in a dream where to
cut wood free from danger. There is no authority for this
worship in the shastrŭs. Dŭkshina-rayŭ is another god, worshipped
in the same manner, and by the same class of persons<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.”</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Last night two boats full of wood-cutters passed us;
they said several of their men had been carried off by tigers.
We have only overtaken four boats all this time in the sunderbands.
During the hot weather people dare not come through
this place; fevers are caught from the malaria: at the present
time of the year it is safe enough. There are no inhabitants in
these parts, the people finding it impossible to live here. We
have a very pleasant party on board, most of whom are going
to Allahabad. The vessel is a good one; the accommodation
good, the food also. It is very expensive, but as it saves one
a dāk trip in this hot weather, or a two or three months’ voyage
in a country vessel, it is more agreeable. The heat in these vile
sunderbands is very great; during the day, quite oppressive; when
we enter the Ganges we shall find it cooler. As we were
emerging from the sunderbands and nearing the river, the banks
presented a scene which must resemble the back settlements in
America. Before this time we had scarcely met with a good-sized
tree. Here the trees partook of the nature of forest:
some people were burning the forest, and had made a settlement.
Barley was growing in small portions, and there were several
dwarf cows. The scene was peculiar; a little bank of mud was
raised to prevent the overflow of the tide; the stumps of the
burned and blackened trees remained standing, with the exception
of where they had been rooted out, and a paddy field<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
formed. Places for look out erected on high poles were numerous,
and thatched over: there a man could sit and watch all
night, lest a tiger should make his appearance. There were a
few miserable huts for the men, no women were to be seen;
nothing could be more primitive and more wretched than these
young settlements in the sunderbands. On the morning of the
10th we quitted this vile place, and anchored at Culna to take
in a fresh supply of coals.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—We arrived at Commercolly; anchored close to the
bank, to take in more coal: it was very oppressive, but the
evening was beautiful; the sky studded with stars, and the new
moon just visible. I sat on deck enjoying the coolness: we
anchored very late, not until it was impossible to see the proper
course to steer on the river. We had at last gained the Ganges.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Passed a great number of boats that were out fishing,
and ran over one of them containing four men, three were
picked up immediately, the fourth passed under the steamer,
from her bows to her stern; he was taken up exhausted, but
uninjured. Some of the passengers are playing at chess, others
reading novels; some asleep, some pacing the deck under the
awning, all striving to find something wherewith to amuse
themselves.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—We arrived off Gaur; I looked with pleasure on its
woods in the distance, recalled to mind the pleasant days I had
passed there, and thought of the well-oiled dākait who had
called on me as his grandmother to save him. It was just at
this place that coming down the river we turned to the right,
and went a short cut down the Bhaugruttī, instead of pursuing
the course of the Ganges. A prize this day fell to my share in
a lottery, in Calcutta, of a silver vase enamelled in gold; but
more of this lottery hereafter.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—I got up early and went on shore at Rājmahal, roamed
in the bamboo jungle and amongst the ruins, until the ringing
of the bell on board the steamer announced the coals were on
board, and the vessel ready to start. Of all the trees in India,
perhaps the bāns, bamboo, is the most useful, as well as the
most graceful. What can be more picturesque, more beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
than a clump of bamboos? From Calcutta to Allahabad, the
common route by the river is eight hundred miles; round by the
sunderbands the distance is nearly eleven hundred.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Passed the Janghiera rock, and anchored at Monghir:
bought lāthīs, that is, solid bamboos, walking-sticks, sixty for
the rupee. The male bamboo is solid, the female hollow. I
bought them for the use of the beaters when M. mon mari goes
out shooting.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—The strong westerly wind sent the fine sand from the
banks in clouds all over the vessel, filling the eyes and ears most
unpleasantly.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Anchored at Benares: the steamer started again at
8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; the view of the ghāts as we passed was beautiful; the
number of persons bathing, their diversified and brilliantly
coloured dresses, rendered the scene one of great interest and
beauty.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Passed Chunar;—the place had lost much of the
beauty it displayed during the rains. A khidmatgār fell overboard,
passed under the vessel from head to stern, and was
picked up by the boat just as he was on the point of sinking.
The skin was torn off the old man’s scalp; he received no
further injury. The next day, to my astonishment, he was in
attendance on his master at dinner-time, and seemed to think
nothing of having been scalped by the steamer!</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Received fruit and vegetables from an old friend at
Mirzapore. I am weary of the voyage, the heat for the last few
days has been so oppressive: very gladly shall I return to the
quiet and coolness of my own home. Aground several times
on sandbanks.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Started early, and arrived within sight of the Fort;
were again fixed on a sandbank; the river is very shallow at
this time of the year. With the greatest difficulty we reached
the ghāt on the Jumna, near the Masjid, and were glad to find
ourselves at the end of the voyage. My husband came down
to receive and welcome me, and drive me home. The great
dog Nero nearly tore me to pieces in his delight. Her Highness
the Bāiza Bā’ī sent her people down to the ghāt to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
salām on my landing, to welcome and congratulate me on my
return, and to say she wished to see me.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to be thus warmly received, and to find myself
once more in my cool and comfortable home on the banks
of the Jumna-jee after all the heat and fatigue of the voyage.</p>

<p>The Brija Bā’ī, one of the Mahratta ladies, was delighted to
see me once again, and performed a certain sort of blessing
called balaiyā lenā, or taking all another’s evils on one’s self;
which ceremony she performed by drawing her hands over my
head, and cracking her fingers on her own temples, in token of
taking all my misfortunes upon herself. This mode of blessing
I have many times seen performed both by men and women,
our dependents and servants, both towards my husband and
myself, on our bestowing any particular benefit upon them; it
expressed the depth of their gratitude.</p>

<p><i>April 6th.</i>—The small-pox is making great ravages; some of
our friends have fallen victims. Lord William Bentinck did
away with the vaccine department, to save a few rupees; from
which economy many have lost their lives. It is a dreadful
illness, the small-pox in this country. People are in a fright
respecting the plague; they say it is at Palee, and has approached
the borders of the Company’s territories; we have
fevers, cholera, and deadly illnesses enough, without the plague;
it is to be trusted <i>that</i> will not be added to the evils of this
climate.</p>

<p>The Palee plague, they say, after all, is not the <i>genuine</i> thing:
it has not as yet entered our territories; however, the Government
of Agra have very wisely adopted preventive measures,
and have established boards of health, cordons, and quarantine,
with the usual measures as to fumigations and disinfectants.
It would be really <i>too bad</i> to give this stranger a playground,
in addition to our old friends fever and cholera, already
domesticated.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—The first time of using the thermantidote was this
morning: how delightful was the stream of cool air it sent into
the hot room! how grateful is the coolness and darkness of the
house, in contrast to the heat and glare on the river!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—This day is the anniversary of the birthday of the Gaja
Rājā Sāhib, and she has sent me an invitation to accompany her
to the Trivenī, the sacred junction of the rivers, to see her perform
a vow, made for her by her mother. The young Princess
from her birth was very sickly, and the mother, fearing the death
of her infant, vowed to Mahadēo that if the god would preserve
her life, she should do pooja as a fakīr, at the shrine, on each
anniversary of her natal day. The time having arrived, the young
Mahratta Princess will perform the vow in the evening. How
much I regret I am unable to attend; unfortunately illness prevents
my quitting the house. Picture to yourself the extraordinary
scene. The young Princess doing pooja before the shrine
of Mahadēo, a descent on earth of Shivŭ the destroyer. Her
delicate form covered from head to foot with a mixture of ashes
and Ganges mud; her long black hair matted with the same,
and bound round her head like a turban; her attire the skin of a
tiger; her necklace of human bones, a rosary in her hand, and
a human skull for an alms-dish,—a religious mendicant; or
making discordant music on a sort of double-headed hand-drum
used by fakīrs, and wandering about within the canvas
walls of the zenāna tent like a maniac! The skull borne by
religious mendicants is to represent that of Brŭmha. Shivŭ,
in a quarrel, cut off one of Brŭmha’s five heads, and made an
alms-dish of it. As the Gaja Rājā appeared as a religious
mendicant, the form in which the lord of the Bhōōtŭs appeared
on earth, I hope some of the ladies represented the latter, a
number of whom always attended Shivŭ. The Bhōōtŭs are
beings partly in human shape, though some of them have the
faces of horses, others of camels, others of monkeys, &amp;c.;
some have the bodies of horses, and the faces of men; some
have one leg, and some two; some have only one ear, and
others only one eye. They would have made charming attendants
on the little Princess, who, wrapped in a tiger’s skin, and
wandering like a maniac, performed, before the shrine of
Mahadēo, the vow made in her name by her mother at her
birth!</p>

<p>The Hon. Miss Frances Eden has been with a party at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Moorshadabad, tiger shooting; they had indifferent sport, and
only killed five tigers, one of which had the happiness of dying
before the eyes of the fair lady. They have returned to Calcutta.
It must have been warm work in the jungles after the
tigers; but when one has an object in view, one is apt to forget
the power of an Indian sun, until a good fever reminds one of
the danger of exposure.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Last night, at midnight, the moon was completely
eclipsed, and darkness fell over the land. The natives are
horror-struck; they say it foretels sickness, disease, and death
to a dreadful extent. It is not unlikely their fears may be
verified: the plague is raging at Palee; it is expected it will
spread ere long to the Company’s territories. Then, indeed,
will the natives believe in the direful presages of the eclipse,
forgetting the plague was the forerunner not the follower of the
signs of wrath in the heavens. Sir Charles Metcalfe has issued
all necessary orders to prevent the intercourse of persons from
the infected cities, with those of the surrounding country. The
small-pox is carrying off the young and the healthy; in every
part of the country you hear of its fatal effects.</p>

<p>The Brija Bā’ī, one of the favourite attendants on the Bāiza
Bā’ī, came to see me; I showed her a prize I had won in a
lottery at Calcutta; a silver vase beautifully enamelled in gold,
value £40. She was much pleased with it, and anxious to
procure tickets in the next lottery for mechanical curiosities.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—The Bāiza Bā’ī sent to me to say she had put into a
lottery, and feared, having only taken seven tickets, she might
not gain a prize, and her people would say she was unlucky.
Therefore, to avert the evil of being called an unlucky person,
she wished to procure the whole of the tickets which remained
unsold. I tried to persuade her that she had tickets in abundance;
nevertheless she sent for thirty more. How curiously
superstitious the natives are! She is as much pleased as a child
at this little bit of gambling for mechanical curiosities and
jewellery.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—The Brija came to request I would visit the camp
to show them how to use a magic-lantern; I did so, but it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
was a failure, being dim and indistinct. In the course of conversation,
wishing to remember a circumstance related by one of
the ladies in attendance, I noted it in my pocket-book, on a
little slate of white china. Her Highness, who observed the
action, asked for the pocket-book, examined it, admired the
delicately white china, and asking for a pencil wrote her own
name upon it. She appeared surprised at my being able to read
and write, accomplishments possessed by herself, but uncommon
among the Mahratta ladies, who are seldom able to attain them,
it being the system of eastern nations to keep their women in
ignorance, imagining it gives them greater power over them.
They are taught to consider it unfit for ladies of rank, and that
it ought to be done for them by their writers and mūnshīs;
nevertheless, they were proud of the accomplishments possessed
by the Bāiza Bā’ī.</p>

<p>Her Highness returned me the pocket-book, which I received
with pleasure, and value highly for the sake of the autograph,
of which, in the plate entitled “<a href="#plate37">The Kharīta</a>,” the writing on
the right-hand side is a fac-simile.</p>

<p>All the needlework is done by women in the zenāna: to
allow a tailor to make your attire would be considered indelicate,
and their clothes are never allowed to be shown to men, lest
they should thus be able to judge of the form of the lady purdanishīn,
<i>i.e.</i> behind the curtain. Imagine the disgust an Asiatic
lady would feel if placed in Regent Street, on beholding figures
displayed in shop windows, intended to represent English ladies
in corsets, bustles, and under petticoats, turning round on poles,
displaying for the laughter and criticism of the men the whole
curious and extraordinary arcana of the toilet of an European!</p>

<p><i>May 5th.</i>—The Bāiza Bā’ī was unable to get the thirty
tickets she sent for in the lottery; eighteen were all that were
unsold, and these were taken by her. She was very fortunate, and
won two prizes; one was an ornament in diamonds attached to
a necklace of two strings of pearls, and a pair of diamond ear-rings,
valued at 2000 rupees, <i>i.e.</i> £200; the second a clock,
valued at 400 rupees, £40: my own ticket proved a blank.
The clock is placed on a rock in the picture, on which are trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
a town, and a fort. In front is the sea, on which float a three-decker
and a cutter, which roll upon the waves moved by
mechanism. The Mahrattas were charmed with it: it is a good
specimen, but they will spoil it in a month.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Copy from a native Akhbar (Court Newspaper).</i></p>

<p><i>July 7th.</i>—“The King of Oude, Nusseer-ood-Deen Hydur,
died this morning; he had been unwell for some days, but not
very ill: he took some medicine, and expired almost immediately,
not without some suspicion of having been poisoned. Colonel
Lowe, the Resident, went to the palace, and was proceeding to
place the late King’s uncle on the throne, by name Nusseer-ood-Deen,
when the Padshah Begam, the late King’s mother,
attended by fifteen hundred soldiers and two elephants, came
to the palace, bringing a boy whom she vowed was the late
King’s son, with the intention of putting him on the throne.
Finding the palace-gates shut, she ordered them to be burst
open by the elephants, entered, placed the boy Moona Jāh
(Feredooa Buckht) on the throne, and desired the Resident
to do him homage. In the mean time, Colonel Lowe
had sent for the troops; on their arrival, he insisted on the
Begam’s quitting the palace; this she would not do. The troops
were ordered to dislodge her party. The Begam and Moona Jāh
were taken prisoners, and sent under a guard to Cawnpore.
The soldiers were dispersed, with the loss of about sixty lives
on the Begam’s side, and two or three sepoys on the Company’s.
Mr. Paton, Assistant to the Resident, was much hurt in
the affray. Colonel Lowe placed the King’s uncle on the
throne, and proclaimed him King of Oude. It is said the
throne was plundered of its jewels to a great amount, and much
treasure was carried off by different persons; some of which
was recaptured a few miles from the city. Since the arrival of
the Padshah Begam and the boy at Cawnpore, every thing has
been quiet in Lucnow; she is to be sent a state prisoner to
Chunar. It is believed the boy is not the late King’s son, but
was made a tool of for the purposes of the Begam.”</p>

on the 30th January, 1831, Khema Jāh and Moona Jāh were
presented with khil’ats (dresses of honour) by his Majesty, who
declared the former to be his heir, and both of them his sons;
the latter, the Moona Jāh, now <i>en route</i> to prison, alone was
believed to be the son of the King. It is rumoured that his
Majesty disowned the boys in the hope that his lately-acquired
wife, Kurchia-Mahal, as he styled her, might present him with
a son, whom he might raise to the throne. Moona Jāh remained
at Chunar until his death in 1846. The King’s uncle, Muhammad
Ulee Shah, an old man, was placed on the masnad; and

<p>1837, <i>Aug.</i>—The first few days in this month we were blessed
with cooling and heavy rain. On the 6th, the annual festival of
the Jenem, or birthday, and the sports of Krishnŭ, the Bāiza Bā’ī
invited me to the camp: on my arrival I found her Highness
seated under a large mango tree; from one of its boughs a swing
was suspended, in which the Gaja Rājā and another lady were
amusing themselves. This festival, in celebration of the sports
of the most popular of the Hindoo deities, was held in all due
form by the Mahrattas; it took place by torch-light, in the cool
of the evening. In the forests on the banks of the Yamuna
Krishnŭ passed his time, playing on the flute, swinging under
the trees, dancing, and sporting with the gopīs. The young
Princess was therefore amusing herself in the swing as a necessary
ceremony; after which, some sixty or eighty Mahratta women
came forward, and performed several dances sacred to the
season, singing as they moved on the turf, in a circular dance
called the rās, in imitation of the gopīs; and the “Songs of
Govinda,” as addressed by Kaniyā to Radha and her companions,
were rehearsed at this festival, with a scenic representation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
of Kaniyā and the gopīs. “The listener could not
depart after once hearing the sound of the flute, and the tinkling
of the gopias’ feet; nor could the birds stir a wing; while the
pupils of the gopias’ eyes all turned towards Creeshna.”</p>

<p>Her Highness presented a rich dress of yellow silk, embroidered
with gold, and a pair of Indian shawls of the same
colour, to the Gaja Rājā, and to many of the ladies in attendance;
yellow being the favourite and distinguishing colour of the
attire of the beloved of the gopīs. On the arms of the young
Mahratta Princess and another lady, the rākhī was bound at the
desire of the Bāiza Bā’ī; the rākhī is also commemorative of
Krishnŭ: the gift is esteemed a high honour, and the mark of
the greatest favour. The value of so distinguished an honour
may be better estimated by the following extract from Colonel
Tod’s “Annals of Mewar.”</p>

<p>“The festival of the bracelet (rākhī) is in spring; and whatever
its origin, it is one of the few when an intercourse of
gallantry of the most delicate nature is established between the
fair sex and the cavaliers of Rajast’han. Though the bracelet
may be sent by maidens, it is only on occasions of urgent
necessity or danger. The Rajpūt dame bestows with the rākhī
the title of adopted brother; and while its acceptance secures
to her all the protection of a ‘<i>cavalière servente</i>,’ scandal itself
never suggests any other tie to his devotion. He may hazard
his life in her cause, and yet never receive a smile in reward;
for he cannot even see the fair object, who, as brother of her
adoption, has constituted him her defender. But there is a
charm in the mystery of such a connexion never endangered by
close observation, and the loyal to the fair may well attach a
value to the public recognition of being the Rākhī-bund Bha’e,
the ‘bracelet-bound brother’ of a Princess. The intrinsic value
of such a pledge is never looked to, nor is it requisite that it
should be costly, though it varies with the means and rank of
the donor, and may be of flock silk and spangles, or gold chains
and gems. The acceptance of the pledge and its return is by
the <i>katchli</i> or corset of simple silk or satin, or gold brocade and
pearls. In shape or application there is nothing similar in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Europe, and, as defending the most delicate part of the structure
of the fair, it is peculiarly appropriate as an emblem of
devotion.”</p>

<p>The rākhī is not exclusively bestowed upon men; a woman
may be distinguished by the honour, and would be publicly
acknowledged and considered as the “bracelet-bound sister” of
the donor.</p>

<p>The evening closed with the performances of some Mahratta
nāch girls, after which I was allowed to depart, having first
partaken of some sweetmeats, which they presented to me with
a jar of dahī (curdled milk); the latter was excellent, and usually
presented at this festival as the favourite food of the gopīs. I
returned home late at night, accompanied as usual by the
horsemen and torch-bearers of the Bāiza Bā’ī.</p>

<p>I have many idols, images of Krishnŭ, in divers forms; a
description of which, with a sketch of his life, will be the best
explanation of the scenes commemorated at the festival. He
has many names, Krishnŭ, Heri, Kaniyā, and is worshipped
under many forms; the idols represent this popular god through
many of the events of his life.</p>

<h3>KRISHNŬ OR KANIYĀ.</h3>

<p>Vishnŭ the Preserver descended on earth in the form of this
god, for the purpose of bringing peace and happiness to all the
world. Krishnŭ is the most celebrated form of Vishnŭ, or,
rather, Vishnŭ himself; and is distinct from the ten avatars or
incarnations. Many of the Hindū gods govern their worshippers
by fear; the dread of the vengeance of the deity ensures
obedience. Krishnŭ is the god of love and good-will: to bless
mankind caused his descent from heaven; and after many
years’ sojourn upon earth for that holy purpose, he suddenly
disappeared.</p>

<p>Such was his power over the affections, that no woman ever
beheld Kaniyā-jee, but she left home and husband and children,
and followed him throughout the world; no eye gazed upon
him that loved him not; and to this day, the beautiful, warlike,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
and amorous Krishnŭ is the most popular deity, and especially
revered by Hindūstanī women.</p>

<p>His parents were Vasudeva and Dewarkī; but he was brought
up in the house of Nanda and Gosodā. In his infant days his
life was sought: to preserve the child, and to conceal him from
the tyrant Kansa, to whom it had been predicted that a child,
the eighth of his family, would destroy him, his uncle fled with
him to the banks of the Jumna: the pursuers were at his heels,
escape was impossible; the infant god commanded the waters
to open a passage for him; the waters heard and obeyed the
command, they stood like a wall on the right side and on the
left; Krishnŭ was carried across by his relative; on reaching
the opposite bank, the waters flowed on as before, and cut off
the pursuit of his enemies.</p>

<p>The city of Mathurā is celebrated as the birth-place of
Krishnŭ. In the family of Nanda he passed his youth amidst
the gopas and gopīs. During his childhood he vanquished the
serpent Kāliya, and slew many giants and monsters: afterwards
he put the tyrant Kansa to death, and kindled the mahā-bārat
or Great War. He is the Apollo of the Hindūs, and is supposed
by Colonel Wilford to have lived about thirteen hundred
years before Christ. Krishnŭ is a terrestrial god, and is represented
by the image in black marble that stands on the right of
Ganesh, in the frontispiece of the first volume; I procured it at
Allahabad during the great fair; it came from Jeypore. The
Hindoo deity is represented playing on the flute, an amusement
to which he was prone when in the forests, surrounded by the
gopīs or milkmaids, who were his ardent admirers and followers;
amongst them he had 16,000 lady-loves, besides his lawful
wives. The Hindoo code allows of two helpmates, but the laws
of man extend not to the gods, and Krishnŭ took unto himself
eight wives, each of whom bore him ten sons; also Radha, the
beloved, the wife of another, to say nothing of the 16,000
gopīs, each of whom also bore him ten sons. Nevertheless,
it is asserted, his life was one of purity, and whatever may tend
to give contrary ideas on the subject is all <i>māyā</i> or <i>illusion</i>.</p>

<p>The Bhagavat Purana gives the following:—“In this happy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
season did Creeshna bestow joy and satisfaction on all living
creatures, and often as he touched his flute in the presence of
the adoring gopias, one exclaimed, ‘Happy animals, inhabiting
Berjeben, who enjoy the sight of Creeshna!’ Another said,
‘O favoured stream of Jumna, and other transparent pools and
fountains, whence Creeshna deigns to drink!’ Another exclaimed,
‘Melodious above all is the flute which resides for ever
on his lip!’ Another said, ‘O happy trees of this wood, under
whose thick shade Creeshna delights to slumber!’ Another said,
‘Honoured above all existing animals are these cattle which
the Creator himself leads to pasture!’ Thus did the gopias
plunge into the fathomless ocean of love, and admire him
who had on a yellow robe, a peacock’s feather on his head,
a brilliant rosary round his neck, and a flute on his lip;
and they said to each other, ‘How happy are we whom he
condescends to love!’ In short, by their purity of faith, and
zeal of attachment, their hearts at length became <i>illuminated</i>,
and they knew and comprehended that Creeshna was the
Creator of the World.”</p>

<p>The Bhagavat Purana gives this personal description:—“He
(Akroon) saw also, standing by him, more distinctly, the form
of Creeshna, of a black colour, wearing a yellow robe, beautiful
to behold; with ruby lips, his neck smooth as white coral, his
arms very long and slender, his breast high and bold, his waist
of elegant proportion, his legs beautiful beyond expression, his
foot like the lotus flower, and his nails red. He had a jewel of
inestimable value in his crown, a chowder round his waist, a
zennar upon his shoulder, a string of flowers round his neck, a
splendid koondel in his ear, the kowstek-men on his arm, and
the shankhe, chakra, geda, and kemel, in his hands.”</p>

<p>The work containing the history of this god is very interesting:
some of the songs are beautiful, especially those in honour
of him who, to the Hindūs, brought peace and happiness upon
earth. In many respects the history is thought by Maurice, in
his “Indian Antiquities,” to resemble that of our Saviour;
on which subject more will be said as we consider another form
of Krishnŭ, as the destroyer of the serpent.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>The dreadful shell panchajanya, of the great shankhe, or shellfish,
whose roar re-echoed from earth to heaven, was used by
Krishnŭ as his trumpet.</p>

<p>So devoted were the gopīs to Krishnŭ the beloved, that if he
wished to ride an elephant, the lovely ladies, with most extraordinary
dexterity, assumed the shape of the animal and bore
him off in triumph. The <a href="#plate29">frontispiece</a> to the second volume,
entitled “Kaniyā-jee and the Gōpia,” is a fac-simile of an old
Hindoo painting commemorative of this feat: the style in
which the figures are grouped is very clever, and does much
credit to the artist; the original is as highly finished as a miniature
painting. The chatr, the emblem of royalty, is borne over
his head; peacock’s feathers form the ornament for his forehead;
and in his hand is the ankus (the elephant goad) and a
lotus flower. The gopīs carry with them their musical instruments;
they are adorned with jewels, and the tail of the animal
shows the beauty and length of their hair.</p>

<p>The second plate of Kaniyā-jee represents the victorious
Heri on a steed formed of the gopīs, bounding and capering
beneath their precious burden, while their musical instruments
and songs enliven his triumphal career. This is also a fac-simile
of an old Hindoo painting, finished with wonderful
delicacy and minuteness.</p>

<p>I have a third painting, Krishnŭ, represented in a palanquin
formed of the gopīs, in which the arrangement and grouping of
the sportive damsels is graceful and elegant. At the festival of
the Huli, which is particularly dedicated to Kaniyā, images of
the god are carried about on elephants, on horses, and in palanquins,
doubtless in commemoration of his sports with the
gopīs; in fact, there was no end to their fooleries and diversions
at Brindāban, the forest Brindā in the vicinity of Mathurā
on the banks of the Jumna. Krishnŭ is always represented of
a dark cerulean blue colour (nila), hence his name Nila-nath,
and he bears a lotus in his hand. Under the title of Heri, in
funeral lamentations, his name only is invoked, and Heri-bol!
Heri-bol! is emphatically pronounced by those bearing a corpse
to its final destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<h3>GOPALŬ.</h3>

<p>This small brazen idol, fig. 4 in the plate entitled “<a href="#plate42">Jugunnathu</a>,”
represents him in his childhood, kneeling on one knee,
and holding a pera, sweetmeat, in his right hand, while he
petitions his mother, saying, “Mā, mā, mīthā’ī, do;” “Mother,
mother, give me sweetmeats.” In this form he is worshipped
as gāo, a cow, and palŭ, nourished. These brazen images are
particularly in favour, and some, being small and well made, are
used as household gods. Sometimes the head of Gopalŭ is
surrounded with a crown of glory, as in the sketch; and in
drawings, the head of Krishnŭ is generally represented encircled
by rays.</p>

<h3>GOPĪ NAT’HŬ.</h3>

<p>This form represents him peculiarly as the god of the gopīs.
Gopī, the wife of a cowherd, and Nat’hŭ, a lord; a young man
dancing amongst the wives of the cowherds, the 16,000 gopīs,
who ever attended him, and were the companions of his
sports.</p>

<h3>RADHA KRISHN.</h3>

<p>Of all his numerous loves and wives, none had power over his
affections equal to Radha, a gopī, whom he carried off from
her husband. So great was her influence, that in pūja the preference
is given to her, and the two images are worshipped
together as “Radha Krishn,” and not as Krishn Radha.</p>

<p>The figure represents the god playing on his flute; and, at his
side, the image of Radha, which has one hand extended, and the
other turned downwards. Their affection has passed into a
proverb: “Apne Radha ko yad ker<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.” As Krishnŭ always
thought of Radha, so they say, “Attend to your own Radha,”
either in anger or laughingly. The shrine of Radha Krishn has
many worshippers; but it is remarkable that none of the lawful
wives of Krishnŭ are worshipped with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>Another figure of Kaniyā-jee in my possession, represents him
under a tree playing on his flute; at the back is one of the
cows of the sacred herd, whom Krishnŭ attended, for by caste
he was a gaōwalla, or cowherd.</p>

<p>Of all the images in my collection the most remarkable is a
brazen one, in which this god is represented killing a serpent
by crushing it with his foot. The Hindoos affirm there is
enmity between the serpent and Krishnŭ. His having his foot
on the head of the cobra di capello, which is evident from the
expanded hood, is singular, as few Hindoos would kill the holy
serpent. This similarity between the Saviour and Krishnŭ is
considered by Maurice as worthy of remark.</p>

<p>A sketch of this idol is given, fig. 3, in the plate entitled
“<a href="#plate42">Jugunnathu</a>,” where, as the destroyer of Kali-nag, “The <i>black</i>
serpent,” which infested the blue waters of the Yamuna or
Jumna, he is represented as bruising him with his foot. He
had, however, many battles with his adversary ere he conquered
him.</p>

<p>The following extract is very poetical:—“One day, in
Dwaraka, which is a second Vaicontha, Creeshna was enjoying
himself with his relations, and sons, and grand-children, and his
16,000 wives, and all his wealth: his elephants, his horses, his
carriages without number, were arranged in order. In the
midst of his golden castle extended his apartments on all the
four sides. His gardens were of golden earth, wherein were
trees of Paradise full of variegated fruits. Peacocks, and
cocelas (Indian nightingales), and other birds, were sporting
therein. Creeshna, on that day, was surrounded by his 16,000
wives, as <i>lightning with a cloud</i>, and they gathered innumerable
flowers as offerings to Creeshna, like the Devatas presenting
flowers to Eendra; and, in all the licence of joy, they and
Creeshna were sporting together, and throwing flowers at each
other. In the garden was a river, whose banks were all gold
and jewels, the water of which, from the reflections of rubies,
appeared <i>red</i>, though perfectly <i>white</i>; it was the <i>water of life</i>;
and thousands of lotuses floated on its surface, among which
innumerable bees were humming and seeking their food. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
this river they bathed and played, Creeshna always in the midst
of them. At length, in the very height of all their revels and
enjoyments, he suddenly disappeared! His principal wives,
which were the eight nayega, remained for some time in profound
astonishment: then they all burst out into the most
passionate exclamations, crying, ‘Whither is he gone?’ One
demanded of the birds if they had seen him, wondering they
could sing until he returned. Another asked of the four-footed
beasts why they made such loud moanings, as if Creeshna had
left and deceived them too. One addressed the sea, ‘Thou
ocean! who art night and day roaring, hath not Creeshna taken
thy fourteen reten, or precious things, also, as well as our
hearts, and is it not therefore thou grievest?’ Another addressed
the moon, ‘O thou lord of the stars! why dost not
thou draw on the world the veil of darkness? Art thou not
affected by his absence? at which every one must be heartless,
like us wretched creatures, who know not what is our fault to
be thus forgotten and forsaken.’ Another spake to the passing
clouds, ‘Ye, too, are impressed with the colour and figure
of Creeshna; and, as he has taken his departure, so ye also are
ever on the wing; and ye, like us mourning for his absence,
overspread every quarter with gloom.’”</p>

<p>In the chapter entitled Jugunnathu will be found an account
of the death of Krishnŭ, and the effect it produced upon the
eight nayega and the 16,000 gopīs.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—A heavy flight of locusts passed over Allahabad;
some were caught and preserved. Why should I keep a
journal? there is nothing to relate in the monotony of an
Indian life at home. The weary heavy day, the hot and sleepless
night, the excessive heat of the weather, the relaxation of
the body, the heaviness of mind, the want of interest in every
thing, the necessity of a colder air and colder climate to restring
nerves that are suffering from fifteen years’ residence in India;—all
this I feel most strongly, and must either return to England
or go to the hills to recruit my weary frame. There is a great
deal of pūja going on in the camp; the Bā’ī wishes me to see
the tamāshā, but I am too unwell for exertion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>The only monkey I ever saw in my life that I did not think
disgusting was one which Mr. H⸺ brought from Assam. A
little fellow perfectly jet black, with white eyebrows—a curiosity.
His master went up dāk to Agra, leaving the monkey, baggage,
and servants to follow in a boat. The monkey was provided
with four goats to furnish him with milk on the voyage; and
some tea and sugar, as it was his custom to take tea every
morning. In a storm the boat went down: the khidmatgār in
charge of it said, “I saved the monkey and my children with
difficulty: what would the master have said had Jackoo been
drowned?” Poor Jackoo’s four goats were drowned, and with
him the khidmatgār called on me at Allahabad to assist in procuring
others. How could a monkey exist without milk to his
tea? His beauty attracted great admiration. He was a high caste
and most holy monkey. Coming down the river from Assam, he
used to sit on the mast-head leaning on his hand. The natives
followed the boat for miles making sālām to him. I believe the
creature came from the Garrows: some are black, others of a
cream colour. They are most affectionate animals, leaving their
food to caress one. They hang for great part of the day by their
long arms from a bough or a bamboo running crossways.</p>

<p>Besides these monkeys the Garrow Hills possess many
curiosities; birds, plants, &amp;c. Amongst the birds is a pheasant
of a grey colour, covered over with eyes like those on the peacock’s
tail, but smaller: it is very beautiful.</p>

<h3>SPORTING IN ASSAM.</h3>

<p>Alluding to that part of the country induces me to insert
extracts from some letters dated from Goalparah, giving an
account of buffalo shooting and sporting in that part of the
country.</p>

<p>“This letter is taken up with Shikār in obedience to your
wishes. You have at heart a large share of the hunting principle,
supposed to characterize mankind in a wild state. I have
seen you in your excursion at Gaur, very anxious where the
covert had a <i>likely</i> look, and so attentive when the game was
started as not to be conscious of the thunder and lightning of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
the pestilent gun, which is such an object of horror in your
hours of ease. I recall these recollections as an excuse to
myself for making a long story of a late shooting excursion.</p>

<p>“In the dawn of last Friday morning nine buffaloes were discovered
in the river making for our hill, two were killed in the
water by villagers in boats, and three on shore by the men of the
detachment; the remaining four took to the conical rising ground,
at the southern extremity of our ridge, which is uninhabited,
and covered with low tree and shrub jungle; a few trees a little
larger rise through this undergrowth, and form the pathway that
surrounds the cone, the finest peepul I have ever seen. This
pathway branches off at the point, where the cone, or rather the
detached hill, begins to rise from the main ridge, going entirely
round it at the height of about four hundred feet above the level
of the river. My havaldar, who took upon himself the ordering
of the hunt, sent five men with muskets round by the left to establish
themselves in the high trees that look into the jungle
supposed to contain the buffaloes. A Mr. F⸺ and myself,
with three or four sepoys and the havaldar, all with guns, proceeded
by the right to some rocks, where, in perfect safety, we
commanded the road, at the back of the hill, by which it was
expected the buffaloes would arrive when dislodged by the left-hand
party. After some time in this post, in a hot sun,—it was
a clear day, and 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,—we heard a shot from the party on the
other side of the hill; and then, after an interval, two more; we
looked eagerly for the buffaloes along the pathway, but still they
did not come; and Mr. F⸺ getting tired, descended from
our place of safety on the rocks, and proposed going round to
where the shots were fired. As it was possible that the men in
the trees might mistake us for buffaloes, I told a sepoy to call
out that we were coming. I advanced a little way and saw two,
one large, the other a calf; they were standing, and about to
turn to go away. I aimed my large gun at the head of the
calf and fired, without effect; I turned round to exchange my
large gun for the double barrel that was loaded, when I found
that, except my orderly, who only carried powder and ball,
and the havaldar who was a little way beyond him, every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
one had fled. The havaldar passed on the call for my double
gun, and the man who held it put it into my hand in time; for
the two buffaloes I had seen, either irritated by my dogs, or
alarmed by the party in their rear, made a dash down the road,
the large one leading, with its head at the charge near the
ground, and snorting at the dogs that were flying before it.
When I changed my gun the head brute was not eight feet from
me: firing both barrels in a hurry and flurry, I jumped down
to the right into the jungle; it was the affair of a moment, and
my dexterity in escape, like Falstaff’s at Gads-hill, was upon
instinct. When I looked along the road in the line of the
charge, I perceived it was completely cleared; all within sight
had made the same jump as myself—the orderly, a little behind
me, the havaldar about ten yards further back; the former had
a loaded gun, and told me afterwards, that he had not fired
because my sacred person happened to be in a line with the
buffaloes,—a civility for which I felt thankful. The men from the
trees had killed an old buffalo, which I found lying across the
road, another still remained in the jungle near the top of the
conical hill. I began to ascend through wet shrubs and over
slippery ground; when half-way up I was joined by Mr. F⸺,
who said he had run for our post on the rock the instant he
heard the buffaloes, and only gained it just in time to see them
pass by: blood was flowing from the shoulder of the leading
one; he himself fired without any effect. We now gained the
top of the hill on which there is an open spot, overgrown with
a coarse jungle grass used in thatching; a small house had
formerly stood upon the place, and the jungle grass probably
sprung up from grass-seed fallen from the chhappar; the thatched
roof. The sepoys, except two with my guns, and my orderly,
whom I trusted, owing to his late steadiness, to hand me my
double gun, took to the trees, and Mr. F⸺ followed their example.
The men on foot began beating the bushes, directed by
the corps of observation in the trees. At length a full-grown
buffalo emerged from the surrounding jungle, and stood before
me on the open space. Instantly every tree opened its fire; a
single grazing shot was the only result; this appeared to decide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
him, lowering his horns to the charge (to speak poetically), his
hoofs swallowed up the space between us; at my feet was the
least possible swell of the ground, and as he reached it I stopped
him in mid career. A ball from my large gun had entered his
head, between the horns,—a little to the right as facing me,
a little to the left as regarded himself. He fell at about six
feet from me.</p>

<p>“You must now never mention Mr. B⸺’s exploit, since an
ordinary mortal has done as much; for my part, I see little
cause of fear from buffaloes. In the cold weather, the usual
shooting season, they are only found in large plains, and no
person with a trustworthy gun has an excuse for failing to kill
in such a situation, where he must have long notice of the
charge. Nothing in Friday’s experience (not man Friday’s) will
deter me from going after very large-horned old ones, or the
young calves, whose heads make excellent soups and stews.
The manner in which I got my gun, and the haste I was obliged
to make in firing, account for my not killing the leading buffaloes
in the road. If they had meditated malice, instead of only
making a rush to get away, I might have been in a jeopardy.
These two buffaloes were brought in during the day by the
sepoys, and all the personages of my story—the nine buffaloes
are, you see, accounted for;—and the tragedy might be represented
on the stage, if nothing but the unities of time and place
were requisite.”</p>

<h3>TIGER HUNTING ON FOOT.</h3>

<p>“A tiger having taken refuge in our hill, I was anxious
to beat him up; the sepoys being eager to join me I told the
men the hunt was quite optional, and that the volunteer party
might take as many muskets as they pleased. We started at
1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and soon fell in with his immense footprints, taking the
direction of the untenanted and jungly hill. A curious sort of
feeling is suggested by following traces of this kind, that are
to abut you know not how soon upon the grim precursor; going
on is like being caught in the rapid leading to a cataract. We
were stationed at the old post of vantage on the rocks, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
sepoys began beating from the opposite part of the hill; a man
in a tree communicated that the tiger was roused, and our
expectation of his coming towards us was for a time intense.
Keeping to the jungle of the hill above the pathway, he turned
back in the direction from which we had come, and avoided the
line of beaters. We quitted the rocks, and placed ourselves in
the pathway beyond the part of the jungle the tiger had taken
to, and the beating by the men bringing round the left of the
line recommenced towards us. Scarcely a minute seemed to
have elapsed before we heard an ugh-ugh from the tiger, though
we were in ignorance at the time it was the roar with which he
accompanied his spring on one of the sepoys, for at that time
we got no sight of the tiger; but the news of a man being
knocked down soon reached us, and a sepoy carried him down
upon his back; a few scratches were visible on the shoulders,
but the extent of the principal injury, which was on the head,
was concealed by the turban, almost completely stained with
blood.</p>

<p>“I heard afterwards that he was a-head of the others,
crouching down, and looking into the jungle grass on the top of
the hill, at the edge of the tree jungle, for traces of the tiger,
when the animal sprung on him from behind, lighting with his
fore-paws on his shoulders; and that the wounds inflicted on
the scalp were from a bite, the teeth luckily slipping over the
surface of the skull. Mr. M⸺ and I took a more advantageous
position on the slope of the rising ground, facing the
conical hill, and at about sixty yards from the place where we
afterwards saw the tiger emerge. An havaldar put himself at
the head of those men who had brought guns, and continued
the hunt, much incensed against the tiger; he at length exposed
his whole flank at about sixty yards to Mr. M⸺ and
myself. Mr. M⸺ fired a little before me, and striking the
tiger, caused him to turn round and escape the heavier bullet
from my gun. The havaldar shortly after shot him again a
little in front of the hip; Mr. M⸺’s shot was behind the
shoulder. We left the tiger for that day; the next evening we
beat the whole hill, but he was not to be found; probably he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
was dead, for an unusual collection of crows, vultures, and
adjutants perching or flying very low, seemed to give token of
his death. The wounded sepoy is doing very well; and the
present of some rupees has made him consider himself a lucky
fellow.”</p>

<h3>THE BĀGHMARS.</h3>

<p>The following extract must not be omitted, since it elucidates
the sketch of “<a href="#plate31">The Spring-bow</a>,” <a href="#Page_73">vol. ii. p. 73</a>.</p>

<p>“I must tell you of a tiger that Lieutenant M⸺ and I
went out to kill, and only succeeded in wounding. Some days
ago, a cow was killed on this our hill of Goalpara, and tigers’
footprints were in beautiful freshness and preservation on the
footpath around that remote conical hill that has been before
mentioned. Captain Davidson’s assistant got two elephants for
beating the jungle, and with a number of sepoys with muskets,
I went out again, and did what was most prudent, by remaining
on some rocks to receive the tiger when he should clear the
jungle, and be driven towards me. The jungle was beat, but no
tiger appeared, and the sepoys, getting tired of waiting, went
into the jungle to beat instead of the elephants; as this was
really dangerous I advised them against it, but uselessly; they
seemed quite unconcerned, and to think it an affair of luck. I
told the little havaldar, who is a leader on these occasions, that
the tiger would kill him; he said, ‘Yes, he would if I were to let
him;’ and this was not the least the bravado it would have been
in the mouth of an European, but the man’s plain meaning. It
is his opinion of the tiger that he is a beast possessed of great
<i>hikmat</i>, cunning, but little heart or liver; and if you oppose him
resolutely, like the devil he will flee from you. The beaters went
cutting down the jungle and shouting; and, to put you out of
suspense, no tiger was found, though the edges of his footprints
were still fresh and crumbling.</p>

<p>“The enterprize of bringing in the tiger was resigned to some
bhagmar people, professional tiger-killers, a party of whom
happened to be in Goalpara, for the purpose of receiving payment
for heads they had collected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“Have you ever seen the bow they set for tigers<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>? It is laid
on one side the animal’s track, and is of stronger and rather
larger proportions than a bahangī bamboo; the joint force of two
or three men draws the string back when the arrow is to be set;
the poisoned head of the arrow, which is carried separate, is
fitted on, and a piece of very thin twine laid from the bow
across the animal’s path; the least touch on this string discharges
the arrow in the same line with deadly precision. This
bow was laid the night after our <i>battue</i>, and the next morning,
about 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, I got the news that the tiger was lying dead upon
the hill-side, and a number of prisoners were about to carry it to
Captain Davidson’s; from him it was brought to me. It was a
fine female, killed with its dinner of cow, and without any
wound but that which killed it;—good proof that it was not the
tiger we saw, who was twice wounded, as was shown by heavy
clots of blood fallen on leaves over which he retreated. The arrow
had buried itself only to the depth of its head, just behind the
left shoulder: the mere wound could not have caused death, but
the poison did; and the tiger was found about sixty yards from
the spot where it came in contact with the string. The poison
is the same in appearance as that on the arrow you got at Rajmahal;
the tiger-killers told me they got it from the inhabitants
of Bhotan, but whether these last make or retail it I do not
know: its efficacy is tremendous.</p>

<p>“I have observed, and the same remark must have occurred
to you, that these Sebundies, and natives generally who live in
the constant vicinity of wild beasts, show a fearlessness of them
that puts to shame the courage of an European on the same
point. To beat through thick jungle, containing a tiger that
had just struck down one of their party, some with only sticks
in their hands, is what no European will do excepting on
compulsion.</p>

<p>“I put the question to my havaldar, a man capable of answering
it from personal courage and experience in such matters,
whether the buffalo charges blindly forward in his first direction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
so as to allow of a person’s escaping by stepping aside?
‘Oh no,’ he said, ‘the buffalo will turn with you.’</p>

<p>“The two that charged me were making a rush to escape,
and were going along a narrow footpath; by jumping aside, I
disappeared into the jungle growing below me on the face of
the hill.</p>

<p>“It is morning, and I am drinking tea; and an instant ago the
shock of an earthquake shook the table at which I am sitting,
making my teacup and saucer rattle together like castanets.
I was in the act of putting my pen on the paper when our hill
began shaking, and then you would have had letters contorted
by earthquake,—rather an out-of-the-way fact in familiar correspondence.
I hope we are not to have three shocks complete, and
according to the degrees of comparison; though such is said to
be the custom of our Mother Earth. Far be it from me, who
hold her in mythological reverence, to wish that she should
forego any pet habits on my account; the only condition I pray
for is the standing of the house I am in.</p>

<p>“The tiger-killers (bhagmar) are a strange set of people; the
trade, like all trades in this country, descends from father to
son, and is, as far as I can compute, a very indifferent livelihood.
Say that a set of men get twenty heads during the year
(this is nearly twice the common average), the reward for this
number is one hundred rupees; which, divided by twelve and
seven, gives each individual of the party one rupee three ānās
a month. Seven were in the set to which my informant
belonged, including, probably, three women. Two of the tiger-killers
lately arrived have good marks from the gentlemen
whose heads they traffic in; according to them all there is only
one portion of their labours attended with danger, and that is,
when seeking the tiger after the bow has been sprung. If the
arrow lodges fairly in the side, the animal is found dead;
should he be less fully hit, he is found, as they call it, in a state
of drunkenness. They then approach him with hand-bows to
finish him. This is the dangerous portion of their work. From
the marks on one of these men, I should think the tiger must
have been in a state of great weakness when he seized him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
The different places in which he is scored show him to have
been fairly in the tiger’s grip, and yet the amount of injury was
small. The other has suffered more severely; and three men,
they say, were killed outright during this year.</p>

<p>“This is the trade that men will take up for the chance of half
an ānā a day! I do not think the Sadr ’Adālat people would enter
the bhagmar department if their salaries were to be doubled.
This shows that the work of the service could be done for four
ānās a day, being three and a half ānās for the respectability.
‘Two bobs for the vartue, and a sice for the larning!’</p>

<p>“For the first time, I have visited the burying-ground. Your
friend’s place of rest is more remarkable than solemn. A small
circular enclosure of upright slips of bamboo, precisely similar
to the defence of a young tree, would seem to indicate to the
traveller, the existence in these savage regions of a race believing
in a vegetable resurrection.”</p>

<p>1837, <i>Aug.</i>—A gentleman who had been paying us a visit
quitted us for Agra just before his baggage boat arrived, in
which were two immense German dogs, one striped like a tiger,—most
warlike animals; they eyed me fiercely, and pulled impatiently
on their chains when brought into the verandah; they
will be good guards at night, but their arrival at Agra will be
a little too late;—like locking the door when the steed has been
stolen. Mr. H⸺ went out to dinner, and did not return
home that night: some thieves took out a pane of glass, opened
the door, carried off his two gun-cases and a writing-desk. A
short distance from the house they broke open the cases, which
they threw away, and made off with the guns, a gold watch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
three seals, and a guard-chain. No traces have been discovered
of the thieves, and our friend must resign himself to the loss,
with the comfort of remembering that I told him several times
he would lose his guns, unless he locked them up in some heavy,
unwieldy chest, that could not readily be carried away.</p>

<p>Solitary confinement in the Fort of Allahabad, a punishment
inflicted on rebellious sipahīs, is dreaded by them more than any
other. The cells for prisoners in the Fort of Chunar are really
solitary; you can neither see out of the window nor hear the
sound of a human voice; both of which they contrive to do at
Allahabad; therefore Chunar is held in all due horror.</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i>—The fever, which, like the plague, carried off its
thousands at Palee, has disappeared; the cordons are removed,
the alarm is at an end, the letters are no longer fumigated, and
the fear of the plague has vanished from before us.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of July, this year, the river had only risen eight
feet above the usual mark; last year, at the same period, late as
the rains were in setting in, the Jumna had risen twenty-four
feet above the usual level; showing the great deficiency of rain
this season.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—The Nawāb Hakīm Menhdī has been reappointed
minister in Oude; how happy the old man must be! He has
been living at Fathīgar, pining for a restoration to the honours
at Lucnow. The Nawāb quitted for Oude; on the first day of
his march, the horse that carried his nakaras (state kettle-drums)
fell down and died, and one of his cannon was upset;—both most
unlucky omens. The Camp and the Minister were in dismay!
To us it is laughable, to the natives a matter of distress. The
right to beat kettle-drums, and to have them carried before you,
is only allowed to great personages. Therefore the omen was
fearful; it will be reported at Lucnow, will reach the ears of the
King, and perhaps produce a bad effect on his mind;—the natives
are so superstitious.</p>

<p>The Maharaj of Gwalior, the Bāiza Bā’ī’s adopted son, who
drove her out of the kingdom, announced a few days ago that a
son and heir was born unto him. The Resident communicated
the happy news to the Government; illuminations took place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
guns were fired, every honour paid to the young heir of the
throne of Gwalior. The Bā’ī sent her grand-daughter on an
elephant, in an amārī (a canopied seat), attended by her followers
on horseback, to do pooja in the Ganges, and to give large
presents to the Brahmāns. As the Gaja Rājā passed along the
road, handfuls of rupees were scattered to the crowd below from
the seat on the elephant. Six days after the announcement of
the birth of a son, the King sent for the Resident, and, looking
very sheepish, was obliged to confess the son was a daughter!
The Resident was much annoyed that his beard had been laughed
at; and, in all probability, the King had been deceived by the
women in the zenāna: perhaps a son had really been born, and
having died, a girl had been substituted;—the only child procurable,
perhaps, at the moment, or approved of by the mother.
A zenāna is the very birth-place of intrigue.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—I am busy with preparations for a march; perhaps, in
my rambles, I shall visit Lucnow, see the new King, and my old
friend the Nawāb Hakīm Menhdī in all his glory. I should like
very much to visit the zenāna, for, although the King be about
seventy, there is no reason why he may not have a large zenāna,
wives of all sorts and kinds,—“the black, the blue, the brown,
the fair,”—for purposes of state and show.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 3rd.</i>—At this moment a large fire is blazing away, and
throwing up volumes of smoke at no great distance from our
house. In this country they chop up straw very finely, as food
for bullocks; an Hindū having collected a large quantity of
bhūsā (this chopped straw), has of late been selling it at a very
high price; in consequence, some one has set fire to the heap,
and has destroyed some hundred mŭns. My khansaman, looking
at it, said very quietly, “He has of late sold his bhūsā at an
unfairly high price, therefore they have secretly set it on fire;
of course they would, it is the custom.” The natives have
curious ideas with respect to justice.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—Called on the Bāiza Bā’ī;—really, the most agreeable
visits I pay are to the Mahratta Camp.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—The Padshah Begam and Moona-jah, the young Prince
of Oude, whom she attempted to put on the throne, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
arrived at Allahabad, state prisoners; they remained a day or
two, their tents surrounded by double guards night and day.
The Begam wished to remain here, but she was forced to march
at last, and has proceeded to Chunar, where she is to remain a
prisoner of state.</p>

<p>The preparations for a march up the country to visit my
friends are nearly completed; my new tents have just arrived
from Cawnpore, they are being pitched and examined, that I
may have no trouble <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The Camp going to meet Lord Auckland at Benares passed
through Allahabad yesterday; two hundred and fifty elephants,
seven hundred camels, &amp;c.,—a beautiful sight; they encamped
very near our house, on the banks of the Jumna.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 23rd.</i>—The Bāiza Bā’ī came down to go on board the
steamer, which she was anxious to see. The vessel was drawn
up to the ghāt, and enclosed with kanats (the canvas walls of
tents). A large party of English ladies attended the Bā’ī, and
several English gentlemen went on board with Appa Sāhib, after
the return of her Highness, who appeared greatly pleased.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 1st.</i>—The Governor-General Lord Auckland, the Hon.
the Misses Eden, and Captain Osborne, arrived at Allahabad
with all their immense encampment. The gentlemen of the
Civil Service and the military paid their respects. Instead of
receiving morning visits, the Misses Eden received visitors in
the evening, transforming a formal morning call into a pleasant
party,—a relief to the visitors and the visited.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—I made my salām to Miss Eden at her tents; she told
me she was going to visit her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī with the
Governor-General, asked me to accompany her, and to act as
interpreter, to which I consented with pleasure.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—The Gaja Rājā Sāhib went on an elephant in state, to
bring the Misses Eden to call on the Bāiza Bā’ī. They arrived
with Lord Auckland in all due form: his Lordship and Appa
Sāhib sat in the outer room, and conversed with her Highness
through the parda. I introduced the Misses Eden to the Bāiza
Bā’ī and her grand-daughter, with whom they appeared pleased
and interested. Twenty-two trays, containing pairs of shawls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
pieces of cloth of gold, fine Dacca muslin, and jewels, were
presented to the Governor-General; and fifteen trays, filled in a
similar manner, to each of the Misses Eden. They bowed to
the presents when they were laid before them, after which the
trays were carried off, and placed in the treasury for the benefit
of the Government.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—I quitted Allahabad on my road to the Hills, under
the escort of our friend Mr. F⸺, near whose tents my own
were to be pitched: the country was swarming with robbers;
they follow the camp of the Governor-General, wherever it
may be.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—Arrived at my tents at Fathīpūr; the scene in the
camp was very picturesque; the troops were drawn out
before the tents of the Governor-General, and all was state
and form, for the reception of the Chiefs of Bandelkhand;
the guns were firing salutes; it was an animated and beautiful
scene.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—I mounted my black horse, and rode at daybreak with
some friends. From the moment we left our tents, we were
passing, during the whole march, by such numbers of elephants,
so many strings of camels, so many horses and carts, and so
many carriages of all sorts, attendant on the troops, and the
artillery of the Governor-General and his suite, that the whole
line of march, from the beginning to the end, was one mass of
living beings. My tents were pitched near the guns of the
artillery, outside the camp at Mulwah: a Rājā came to call on
Lord Auckland, a salute was fired; my horses, being so near,
became alarmed; the grey broke from his ropes, fell on the
pegs to which he was picketed, and lamed himself; another
broke loose; a camel lamed himself, and we had some difficulty
in quieting the frightened animals.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—I was unwell from over-fatigue, most uncomfortable.
In the evening I roused myself to dine with Lord Auckland to
meet Prince Henry of Orange. His Royal Highness entered
the navy at eight years of age, and has been in the service ten
years, in the “Bellona” frigate. Accompanied by his captain,
he came up dāk to spend a few days with Lord Auckland.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
The Prince is a tall, slight young man, and, apparently, very
diffident.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Arrived at Cawnpore, and paid a long promised visit to
a relative. As the Misses Eden were at home in the evening,
I accompanied Major P⸺ to pay my respects. We lost our
way in the ravine from a dense fog: when we reached the tents
the whole station was assembled there, quadrilles and waltzing
going forward.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—On Christmas-day the old Nawāb Hakīm Menhdī, the
minister of Oude, of whom I have so often spoken, breathed his
last at Lucnow. His death was announced to me in a very
original note from his nephew and heir, the General Sāhib:—</p>

<p>“Dear Madam,—I have to inform you that my poor uncle
Nawāb Moontuzim-ood-Dowlah Bahadur departed this life at
the decree and will of Providence, at half-past three o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
the day before yesterday, Monday, the 25th inst., after a short
illness of six days only; consequently seeing him any more in
this world is all buried in oblivion. The Begam Sāhiba tenders
her kind remembrances to you. With best wishes, believe me
to be, dear Madam, yours very faithfully, Ushruff-ood-Dowla
Ahmed Ally Khan Bahadur.”</p>

<p>I was sorry to hear of the death of the Nawāb. How soon
it has followed on the bad omens of his march!</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Received an invitation to breakfast with the son of
the King of Oude (who had arrived from Lucnow), to meet the
Governor-General’s party: went there on an elephant: an
immense party were assembled in a very fine tent. Shortly
after, breakfast was announced: when it was over we returned
to the former tent, when the presents were brought forth; they
consisted of a fine elephant, with a howdah on his back, and
the whole of the trappings of red cloth and velvet richly embroidered
in gold. Two fine horses next appeared, their housings
of velvet and gold; and the bridles were studded with
rows of turquoise. A golden palanquin was next presented. On
the ground, in front of the party, were twenty-three trays, the
present to Lord Auckland; they were filled with Cashmere
shawls in pairs, pieces of kimkhwāb, and necklaces of pearls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
emeralds, and diamonds. Fifteen trays of shawls and cloth of
gold, with fine pieces of Dacca muslin, were presented to each
of the Misses Eden; two of the trays contained two combs set
in superb diamonds, and two necklaces of diamonds and emeralds,
such as are hardly ever seen even in India. All these
fine things were presented and accepted; they were then carried
off and placed in the Government treasury. The Government
make presents of equal value in return.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—The station gave a ball to the Governor-General and
the Misses Eden; the next day Prince Henry of Orange, the
Misses Eden, and Captain Osborne, went over to Lucnow for a
few days, leaving Lord Auckland at Cawnpore; they returned
on the 30th, when the Prince quitted the party, and went off
with the Captain of “the Bellona” to visit Agra.</p>

<p>1838, <i>Jan. 1st.</i>—Sir Charles Metcalfe, who had arrived from
Agra, resigned his power into Lord Auckland’s hands, and
departed for England.</p>

<p>I am very comfortable, every thing being <i>en règle</i>, having a
double set of tents, two horses for the buggy, two Arabs for
riding, ten camels to carry the baggage, and two bullock-carts for
the women. The men servants march with the camels: every
thing is required in duplicate. One tent, with the people, starts
in the evening, and is pitched at the end of the march, and
breakfast is there ready for me early the next morning.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—A cold day with a high wind: my tents are pitched on
a dusty plain, without a blade of grass, the wind and dust
careering up and down. My little tent is quite a pearl in the
desert, so white and fresh: small as it is, it is too large to take
to the hills, and I have this day written for two hill tents and a
ghoont (a hill pony) to be bought for me, that they may be
ready on my arrival.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Quitted Chobīpūr, and arrived early at the end of the
march; found the tent only half pitched, no breakfast ready; in
fact, the servants, leaving every thing about in every direction,
had gone to sleep. The thieves, who are innumerable all over
the country, taking advantage of their idleness, had carried off
my dital harp with the French blankets and the pillows from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
my charpāī. These things were under the sentry, but he was
asleep on his post. The box was found in a field, near the
tent, but the dital harp was gone. I had always made a point of
pitching my tents near the great camp, for the sake of the protection
it afforded. “It is dark under the lamp<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>,” was exemplified;—a
proverb used when crimes are committed near the seat
of authority. Strict orders were of course issued to my people
to be more on the alert in future. “When the wolf has run
away with the child the door is made fast<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.” In the evening I
dined with the Governor-General, and was much gratified with
the sight of some of Miss Eden’s most spirited and masterly
sketches.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—Arrived at Urowl. Here the famine began to show
itself very severely; I had heard it talked about, but had never
given it much thought, had never brought the image of it before
my mind’s eye. No forage was to be procured for the camels
or bullocks, therefore they went without it; it was not to be
had for money, but gram was procurable, of which they had a
meal. The horses got gram, but no grass; the country was so
completely burnt up, scarcely a blade or rather a root of grass
could be cut up, and every thing was exceedingly expensive.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—At six <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, when I quitted my tent to mount my
horse, it was bitterly cold; the poor starving wretches had
collected on the spot which my horses had quitted, and were
picking up the grains of gram that had fallen from their nose-bags;
others were shivering over a half-burned log of wood my
people had lighted during the night. On the road I saw
many animals dead from over-exertion and famine; carts overturned;
at one place a palanquin garī had been run away with,
the wheels had knocked down and passed over two camel
drivers; one of the men was lying on the road-side senseless
and dying.</p>

<p>On reaching the Stanhope, which had been laid half way for
me, the horse gave some annoyance while being put into harness;
when once in, away he went, pulling at a fearful rate, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
roads half way up the leg in sand, full of great holes, and so
crowded with elephants, camels, artillery, cavalry, and infantry,
and all the camp followers, it was scarcely possible to pass through
such a dense crowd; and in many places it was impossible to
see beyond your horse’s head from the excessive dust. Imagine
a camp of 11,000 men all marching on the road, and such a
road!</p>

<p>Away rushed the horse in the Stanhope, and had not the
harness been strong, and the reins English, it would have been
all over with us. I saw a beautiful Persian kitten on an Arab’s
shoulder; he was marching with a long string of camels carrying
grapes, apples, dates, and Tusar cloth for sale from Cabul.
Perched on each camel were one or two Persian cats. The
pretty tortoise-shell kitten, with its remarkably long hair and
bushy tail, caught my eye;—its colours were so brilliant. The
Arab ran up to the Stanhope holding forth the kitten; we
checked the impetuous horse for an instant, and I seized the
pretty little creature; the check rendered the horse still more
violent, away he sprang, and off he set at full speed through
the encampment which we had just reached. The Arab thinking
I had purposely stolen his kitten, ran after the buggy at full
speed, shouting as he passed Lord Auckland’s tents, “Dohā’ī,
dohā’ī, sāhib! dohā’ī, Lord sāhib!” “Mercy, mercy, sir!
mercy, Governor-General!” The faster the horse rushed on,
the faster followed the shouting Arab, until on arriving at my
own tents, the former stopped of his own accord, and the
breathless Arab came up. He asked ten rupees for his kitten,
but at length, with well-feigned reluctance, accepted five, declaring
it was worth twenty. “Who was ever before the happy
possessor of a tortoise-shell Persian cat?” The man departed.
Alas! for the wickedness of the world! Alas! for the Pilgrim!
She has bought a cocky-olli-bird!</p>

<p>The cocky-olli-bird, although unknown to naturalists by that
name, was formerly sold at Harrow by an old man to the boys,

<p>The bright burnt sienna colour of the kitten is not tortoise-shell,
she has been dyed with hinnā! her original colour was
white, with black spots; however, she looks so pretty, she must
be fresh dyed when her hair falls off; the hinnā is permanent
for many months. The poor kitten has a violent cold, perhaps
the effect of the operation of dyeing her: no doubt, after having
applied the pounded menhdī, they wrapped her up in fresh
castor-oil leaves, and bound her up in a handkerchief, after the
fashion in which a native dyes his beard. Women often take
cold from putting hinnā on their feet.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT HINDŪ RUIN.</h3>

<p>My tents were pitched near Merunkee Sarā’e: in the evening,
as I was riding into Kanauj, at the tomb of Bala Pīr, I met
Captain C⸺ on an elephant, and accompanied him to see the
remains of a most ancient Hindū temple. Of all the ruins I
have seen this appears to me the most remarkable and the most
ancient: the pillars are composed of two long roughly-hewn
stones, placed one upon the other, and joined by a tenon and
mortise; no cement of any sort appears to have been used.
The style of the building is most primitive, and there is a little
carving—and but a little—on some of the stones; the structure
is rapidly falling into decay. I regret exceedingly I cannot
remember the marvellous stories that were related to me connected
with this ruin and its inhabitants.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“For they were dead and buried and embalm’d,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Long after their primæval race was run.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On my return to the tents, my ayha complained bitterly of
the annoyance she had experienced on the long march of thirteen
miles and a half, over bad roads; she had been upset in her
bailī, a native carriage, drawn by two bullocks, and her serenity
was sadly discomposed.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—This day, being Sunday, was a halt,—a great refreshment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
after toil; and Divine Service was performed in the tent of the
Governor-General; after which, at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, I went, on an
elephant, to see two most ancient and curious specimens of
Hindū sculpture, the figures of Rām and Lutchman, which are
about five feet in height, carved on separate stones, and surrounded
by a whole heaven of gods and goddesses: the stones
themselves, which are six or seven feet high, are completely
covered with numerous images; and a devi (goddess), rather
smaller, is on one side.</p>

<p>Passing through the bazār at Kanauj was a fearful thing.
There lay the skeleton of a woman who had died of famine;
the whole of her clothes had been stolen by the famished
wretches around, the pewter rings were still in her ears, but not
a rag was left on the bones that were starting through the black
and shrivelled skin; the agony on the countenance of the corpse
was terrible. Next to her a poor woman, unable to rise, lifted
up her skinny arm, and moaned for food. The unhappy
women, with their babies in their arms, pressing them to their
bony breasts, made me shudder. Miserable boys, absolutely
living skeletons, pursued the elephant, imploring for bread:
poor wretches, I had but little money with me, and could give
them only that little and my tears: I cannot write about the
scene without weeping, it was so horrible, and made me very
sick. Six people died of starvation in the bazār to-day. Lord
Auckland daily feeds all the poor who come for food, and gives
them blankets; five or six hundred are fed daily;—but what
avails it in a famine like this? it is merciful cruelty, and only
adds a few more days to their sufferings; better to die at once,
better to end such intolerable and hopeless misery: these people
are not the beggars, but the tillers of the soil. When I was
last at Kanauj the place was so beautiful, so luxuriant in vegetation,—the
bright green trees, the river winding through low
fields of the richest pasture: those fields are all bare, not a
blade of grass. The wretched inhabitants tear off the bark of
the wild fig tree (goolèr), and pound it into food; in the course
of four or five days their bodies swell, and they die in agonies.
The cultivators sit on the side of their fields, and, pointing to
their naked bodies, cry, “I am dying of hunger.” Some pick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
out the roots of the bunches of coarse grass, and chew them.
The people have become desperate; sometimes, when they see a
sipahī eating they rush upon him to take his food; sometimes
they fall one over the other as they rush for it, and having
fallen, being too weak to rise, they die on the spot, blessed in
finding the termination of their sufferings. The very locusts
appear to have felt the famine; you see the wings here and
there on the ground, and now and then a weak locust pitches
on a camel. Every tree has been stripped of its leaves for food
for animals. The inhabitants of Kanauj, about a lākh of
people, have fled to Oogein and to Saugar. The place will be a
desert; none will remain but the grain merchants, who fatten
on the surrounding misery. There is no hope of rain for five
months; by that time the torments of these poor wretches will
have ended in death;—and this place is the one I so much
admired from the river, with its rich fields, and its high land
covered with fine trees and ruins!</p>

<p>I returned to the ancient Hindū building that had so much
interested me, to sketch it at leisure, and was thus employed,
when I was surrounded by numbers of the starved and wretched
villagers. I performed my task as quickly as possible, and
whatever errors there may be in the performance, must be
attributed to the painful scene by which I was surrounded;
some of the poor people flung themselves on the ground before
me, attempting to perform pā-bos, that is, kissing the feet;
wildly, frantically, and with tears imploring for food; their
skeleton forms hideously bearing proof of starvation; the very
remembrance makes me shudder. I quitted the ruin, and
returned to my tents. To-morrow we quit Kanauj, thank
God! It is dreadful to witness and to be unable to relieve such
suffering.</p>

<p>I picked up a curious piece of ancient sculpture, Mahadēo,
with Pārvatī in the centre, and a devi on each side, which I
brought to my tent on the elephant. Considering it too heavy
to carry about on the march, we buried it at night under a
peepul tree, and shall take it away on our return home, if it will
please to remain there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>At this place I learned the following legend. In the olden
time, Kanauj was a great city. There were giants in those
days, men of enormous stature, who dwelt at Kanauj, and with
three steps could accomplish the distance hence to Fathīgarh.
<i>En passant</i>, be it remarked, it took the feeble mortals in the
camp of the Governor-General three long marches, during
three long days, to pass over the same ground. The women
were also very powerful; on brushing their houses of a morning,
it was their custom to pitch the dirt a stone’s throw from the
door. Now, the women being as strong as the men, the dirt
was thrown as far as Fathīgarh in a heap; and on the rising
ground produced by these dirt-throwing damsels was afterwards
erected the Fort of Fathīgarh.</p>

<p>My journal is a constant source of pleasure; it not only amuses
me to record passing events, but in writing it I perform a promise
given ere I quitted England. Letters from home assure
me of the delight with which it is received, of the pleasure with
which they follow me through my wanderings, and of the
interest they feel in all those scenes that pass before me. The
religion of the Hindūs, who are perhaps the most extraordinary
people on the face of the earth, is to my friends as interesting as
to me; they wish for more information on the subject, therefore,
however difficult the task, it must be performed. Performed!—“Aye,
there’s the rub,” but how? shall I send them, <i>pour commencer
au commencement</i>, a catalogue of the deities in the Hindū
Pantheon, amounting to three hundred and thirty millions of
gods and goddesses? 330,000,000, “Taintīs karor déotā!”—The
nomenclature would be somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>Shall I send them the names of the three hundred gods which
are interwoven in silk and gold on the janéo I wear around my
neck, to which is appended the key of my cabinet? I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
three of these sacred janéos, purchased at Benares; unlike the
Brahmanical thread, which bears the same name, but which is
merely thread tightly twisted, these janéos are thick strong
ribbons made of red, black, yellow, and white silk, interwoven
in which are the names of the gods. They are worn over the
right shoulder and under the left arm on particular days of
pūja, and are esteemed very holy. On one in my possession,
formed of red and different coloured silk, the names of three
hundred of the gods are interwoven; the letters are in the
Sanscrit character; the breadth of the band one inch. On a
second, formed of black and coloured silk, and rather narrower,
at intervals in several places on the sacred band is woven in the
same character, “Srī Radha Krishn.” The third is still narrower,
and similarly ornamented. The janéo is considered to
possess many virtues: some that I saw at Benares were from
two to three inches in breadth, of rich silk, and the names interwoven
in gold and silver thread; they were handsome and very
expensive.</p>

<p>In my youthful days I devoted much time to drawing out the
pedigree of my own family, a task that to me was one of
pleasure, <i>on revient toujours à ses premiers amours</i>; in lieu of a
dry catalogue of the three hundred and thirty millions of Hindū
deities, I will form a short pedigree, if such a term be applicable
to it, to assist my own memory, and for the amusement
and edification of the beloved one to whom this my journal is
dedicated.</p>

<h3>BRŬMHŬ.</h3>

<p>The Hindūs worship God in unity, and express their conceptions
of the Divine Being and his attributes in the most awful
and sublime terms. God, thus adored, is called Brŭmhŭ, “One
Brŭmhŭ without a second,” the one eternal mind, the self-existent,
incomprehensible spirit, the all-pervading, the divine
cause and essence of the world, from which all things are
supposed to proceed, and to which they return; the spirit, the
soul of the universe. Amongst the Hindūs the ignorant address
themselves to idols fashioned by the hand of man; the sage
worships God in spirit. Of that infinite, incomprehensible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
self-existent spirit, no representation is made: to his direct and
immediate honour no temples rise; nor dare an Hindū address
to him the effusions of his soul, otherwise than by the mediation
of a personified attribute, or through the intervention of a
priest; who will teach him that gifts, prostration, and sacrifice,
are good, because they are pleasing to the gods; not as an
unsophisticated heart must feel, that piety and benevolence are
pleasing to God because they are good. But although the
Hindūs are taught to address their vows to idols and saints,
these are still but types and personifications of the deity, who is
too awful to be contemplated, and too incomprehensible to be
described. The Hindū erects no altar to Brŭmhŭ “Of him,
whose glory is so great, there is no image” (<i>Veda</i>), and we must
proceed to the consideration of the personified attributes of that
invisible, incomprehensible Being, “which illumines all, delights
all, whence all proceeded; that by which they live when born,
and that to which all must return” (<i>Veda</i>).</p>

<p>Brŭmhŭ, the one god without a second, became a trinity, and
the three emanations or parts of one Brŭmhŭ, are Brahma,
Vishnŭ, and Shivŭ. The first presided over Creation, the
second over Preservation, and the third over Destruction. The
three principal goddesses are, Durgā, Lachhmī, and Saraswatī.</p>

<h3>BRAHMA, THE CREATOR.</h3>

<p>In mythology, Brahma is the first of the Hindū Triad, the three
great personified attributes of Brŭmhŭ, or the Supreme Being;
but his name is not so often heard of in India as either of the
other two great powers of Preservation and Destruction. He is
called the first of the gods, the framer of the universe. From
his mouth, arm, thigh, and foot, proceeded severally the priest,
the warrior, the trader, and the labourer; these, by successive
reproduction, people the earth: the sun sprung from his eye,
and the moon from his mind.</p>

<p>Brahma is usually represented with four faces, said to represent
the four quarters of his own work; and said, sometimes, to
refer to a supposed number of elements of which he composed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
it; and to the sacred Vedas, one of which issued from each
mouth. Red is the colour supposed to be peculiar to the creative
power: we often see pictures of Brahma of that colour;
which also represents fire, and its type the sun. Images are
made representing Brahma, but none of Brŭmhŭ, the one
eternal God.</p>

<p>Brŭmhŭ, or the Supreme One, say the Brahmāns, has been
pleased to manifest himself in a variety of ways from age to
age in all parts of the habitable world. When he acts immediately,
without assuming a shape, or sending forth a new
emanation, or when a divine sound is heard from the sky, that
manifestation of himself is called <i>acasavani</i>, or an <i>ethereal voice</i>:
when the sound proceeds from a meteor or a flame, it is said to
be <i>agnipuri</i>, or <i>formed of fire</i>: but an <i>avatara</i> is a descent of the
deity in the shape of a mortal; and an <i>avantara</i> is a similar
incarnation of an inferior kind, intended to answer some purpose
of less moment. The Supreme Being, and the celestial emanations
from him, are <i>niracara</i>, or <i>bodiless</i>; in which state they
must be invisible to mortals; but when they are <i>pratyacsha</i>, or
<i>obvious to the sight</i>, they become <i>sacara</i>, or embodied, and
expressive of the divine attributes, as Krishnŭ revealed himself
to Arjun, or in a human form, which Krishnŭ usually bore; and
in that mode of appearing the deities are generally supposed to
be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. Those
who follow the <i>Purva Mimansa</i>, or the philosophy of Jamini,
admit no such incarnations of deities; but insist that the
devas (gods) were mere mortals, whom the Supreme Being was
pleased to endow with qualities approaching to his own attributes:
and the Hindūs in general perform acts of worship to some of
their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified in consequence
of their eminent virtues.</p>

<p>All the principal, and several of the secondary deities, or
incarnations of the principal, have wives assigned them, who are
called <i>sacti</i>; and, except in sex, exactly represent their respective
lords, being their <i>energy</i> or <i>active power</i>, the executors of their
divine will. The sacti of Brahma is Saraswatī, the goddess of
harmony and the arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Many deities have vehicles or <i>vahans</i> allotted to them: that
of Brahma and of his <i>sacti</i> is the swan or goose, called <i>hanasa</i>;
but he is not so frequently seen mounted on it, as other deities
are on theirs: he is represented with his swan or goose in the
cave of Elephanta. Saraswatī, the goddess of learning, is sometimes
represented as the daughter of Brahma, and wife of
Vishnoo; and as the latter I have placed her in the annexed
plate.</p>

<p>Brahma is represented as a man with four faces, of a gold
colour, dressed in white garments, riding on a goose; in one
hand he holds a stick, and in another a kŭmŭndŭloo or alms-dish.
He is never adopted as a guardian deity.</p>

<h3>VISHNŬ, THE PRESERVER.</h3>

<p>Vishnŭ is the second person in the Hindū triad; he is
a personification of the preserving power, and has on the
whole a greater number of adorers than any other deity or
attribute.</p>

<p>I have a brazen image representing Vishnŭ reposing on a
serpent with seven heads; perhaps intended to represent Sesha,
the vast thousand-headed serpent, or <i>ananta</i>, as the serpent, as
well as Vishnŭ, is sometimes named; meaning <i>endless</i> or <i>infinite</i>.
Vishnŭ is represented as he is described in the Scanda Purana,
asleep in the bosom of the waters, when a lotus arose from his
body, which soon reached the surface of the flood. Brahma
sprung from the flower, and looking round without seeing any
creature on the boundless expanse, imagined himself to be the
first-born. Vishnŭ denied his primogeniture; they had an
obstinate battle, which lasted until Mahadēo cut off one of
Brahma’s five heads, which settled the affair, and the image of
Brahma bears only four heads. Nothing can be more luxurious
than this image, the god floating on the water-lily, and the
serpent, whose outspread heads afford him shade during his
repose; while two celestial beings, sitting at his feet, shampoo
him during his slumber. The one is his sacti, Lachhmī, the
goddess of beauty, who was produced with the <i>chowda ratny</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
or fourteen gems, at the churning of the sea; the other, another
sacti, Saraswatī, the goddess of literature and harmony, the
daughter of Brahma.</p>

<p>Vishnŭ and Shivŭ are said each to have a thousand names;
they are strung together in verse, and repeated on certain
occasions by Brahmāns as a sort of litany, accompanied sometimes
with the rosary. Images of Vishnŭ, either representing
him in his own person, or in any of his avataras or incarnations,
may be generally distinguished from those of other deities by a
shell (chank), and a sort of wheel or discus, called chakra.
The chank is the large buccinum, sometimes seen beautifully
coloured like a pheasant’s breast. The chakra is a missile
weapon, very like our quoit, having a hole in its centre, on
which it is twirled on the forefinger, and thrown at the destined
object; it has a sharp edge, and irresistible fire flames from its
periphery when whirled by Vishnŭ. Two other attributes
appertain to him; the gadha, a mace or club; and the padma,
a lotus. The god is represented four-handed, and wears on his
head a high cap of singular form, called mugut. At the back of
this brazen idol lotus-leaves form a sort of glory, crowned by
the head of a bird, perhaps intended as an emblem of his
vahan Garuda. Vishnŭ is sometimes seen mounted on an
eagle, or rather on an animal composed of an eagle and a man,
cleaving the air, and soaring to the skies. Vishnŭ is represented
in the form of a black man, with yellow garments.</p>

<h3>SHIVŬ, THE DESTROYER.</h3>

<p>The third personage in the Hindū trinity is Shivŭ, the Destroyer:
he is represented as a silver-coloured man, with five faces; an
additional eye and a half-moon grace each forehead; he has four
arms; he sits on a lotus, and wears a tiger-skin garment.
Nandi is the epithet always given to the white bull, the vehicle
of Shivŭ, on which he is frequently seen riding; in his temple
it is represented sometimes of great dimensions, <i>couchant</i>,
and it is commonly met with in brass. The Nandi is often
represented <i>couchant</i>, bearing the particular emblem the type of
Shivŭ, crowned by the five heads of the god; the trident, called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
trisula, is his usual accompaniment. Durgā and Satī are his
consorts.</p>

<p>Having thus given a brief account of the Hindū trinity, or
emanations of the “One Brŭmhŭ without a second,” let me
return to Vishnŭ, the second personage of the triad, and trace
him through his various descents.</p>

<h3>THE TEN AVATARS.</h3>

<p>The word itself, in strictness, means a descent; but, in its
more extended signification, it means an <i>incarnation</i> of a deity
in the person of a human being. Such incarnations have been
innumerable; however, speaking of the avatars, it is generally
meant to be confined to the ten avatars of Vishnŭ, which are
thus usually arranged and named:—l. Mach, Machchha, or the
Fish. 2. Kurma, or the Tortoise. 3. Varaha, or the Boar.
4. Nara-singha, or the Man-lion. 5. Vamana, or the Dwarf.
6. Parashu-Rāma, the name of the favoured person in whom the
deity became incarnate. 7. Rāma-Chandra, the same. 8. Bala-Rāma,
the same. 9. Buddhŭ, the same. 10. Kalkī, or the
Horse. Of these, nine are past; the tenth is yet to come.</p>

<h4>1. MACH, MACHCHHA, OR THE FISH.</h4>

<p>I have a curious and highly-illuminated Hindū painting of
this first avatar, representing Vishnŭ as a black man, with four
arms, issuing erect from the mouth of a large fish, which is
represented in the water, surrounded by flowers of the lotus.
The head of the Preserver is encircled by rays of glory, and he
appears in the act of destroying the demon Hayagriva, whom
he has seized by the hair with one hand, while, on the fingers of
another hand, he is whirling round the disk with which to
destroy the evil spirit. The demon is represented as a red man,
issuing from a shell; on his forehead are two golden horns, and
in his hands one of the vedas, the sacred books. On the right
of the picture stands Brahma, a pale-coloured man, with four
arms and four heads, each of which has a long white beard: three
of the vedas are in his hands, and the fourth is in one of the
four hands of Vishnŭ. The following is a literal translation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
from the Bhagavata, and the particular cause of this first or fish
avatar is described as follows:—“At the close of the last calpa
there was a general destruction, occasioned by the sleep of
Brahma; whence his creatures in different worlds were <i>drowned
in a vast ocean</i>. Brahma, being inclined to slumber, desiring
repose after a lapse of ages, the strong demon Hayagriva came
near him, and stole the vedas which had issued from his lips.
When Heri, the Preserver of the Universe, discovered this deed
of the Prince Danavas, he took the shape of a minute fish called
Saphari. A holy king, named Satiyaurata, then reigned, a
servant of the spirit <i>which moved on the waves</i>, and so devout
that <i>water</i> was his only sustenance. As this pious king was
making a libation in the river, the preserving power, under the
form of the fish Saphari, appeared to him, at first under a very
minute form, but gradually assuming a larger bulk, at length
became a fish of immense magnitude.” The astonished king
concludes a prayer by expressing his anxiety that the <i>lotus-eyed
deity</i> should inform him why he assumed that shape. The Lord
of the Universe returned the following answer: “‘In seven days
from the present time, O thou tamer of enemies, the three
worlds will be plunged in <i>an ocean of death</i>; but in the midst of
the destroying waves, a large vessel, sent by me for thy use, shall
stand before thee. Then shalt thou take all medicinal herbs, all
the variety of seeds, and accompanied by <i>seven saints</i>, encircled
by pairs of all brute animals, thou shalt enter the spacious ark,
and continue in it, secure from the flood, on one immense
ocean, without light, except the radiance of thy holy companions.
When the ship shall be agitated by an impetuous
wind, thou shalt fasten it with a large sea-serpent on my horn;
for I will be near thee: drawing the vessel with thee and thy
attendants, I will remain on the ocean, O chief of men, until a
day of Brahma (a year) shall be completely ended.’” He spake
and vanished from his sight. Satiyaurata humbly and devoutly
waited the awful event, and while he was performing grateful
services to Heaven, the sea, overwhelming its shores, deluged
the <i>whole earth</i>: and it was soon perceived to be augmented <i>by
showers from immense clouds</i>. He, still meditating on the command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
of Bhagavat, saw the vessel advancing, and entered it with
the chief of Brahmāns, having carried into it the medicinal
plants, and conformed to the directions of Heri. Alarmed at
the violence of the waves, and the tossing of the vessel, the
pious king invoked the assistance of the preserving power,
“when the god appeared again distinctly on the vast ocean, in
the form of a fish, blazing like gold, extending a million of
leagues, with one stupendous horn; on which the king, as he
had before been commanded by Heri, tied the ship with a cable
made of a vast serpent, and, happy in his preservation, stood
praising the destroyer of Madhu. When the monarch had
finished his hymn, the primeval male Bhagavat, who watched
for his safety on the great expanse of water, spoke aloud to his
own divine essence, pronouncing a sacred purana; the substance
of which was an infinite mystery, to be concealed within the
breast of Satyaurata; who, sitting in the vessel with his saints,
heard the principle of the soul, the Eternal Being, proclaimed
by the preserving power. Then Heri, rising together with
Brahma from the destructive deluge, which was abated, slew the
demon Hayagriva, and recovered the sacred books. Satyaurata,
instructed in all divine and human knowledge, was appointed in
the present calpa, by the favour of Vishnŭ, the seventh menu,
surnamed Vaivaswata; but the appearance of a horned fish to
the religious monarch was all <i>maya</i> or delusion.”</p>

<h4>2. KURMA, OR THE TORTOISE.</h4>

<p>The second grand avatara of Vishnŭ, called the Tortoise,
evidently, like that of the fish, refers to the Deluge. Of this I
have an illuminated painting, representing Kurma-Rājā, the king
of the tortoises, on whose back the mountain Mandara is poised;
and just above it, Lachhmī, the goddess of beauty, is seated
on the flower of the water-lily. This avatar was for the purpose
of restoring to man some of the comforts and conveniences that
were lost in the flood. The vast serpent, Vasoky, is represented
coiled round the mountain, serving as a rope; the head
of the serpent is held by two of the soors (demons), represented
as men with two horns on their heads; the tail of the animal is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
held by Brahma, distinguished by his four heads, and the Vedas,
the sacred books, in two of his hands; and next to him assisting
in the operation is the blue form of Mahadēo, a form of Vishnŭ,
his head surrounded by a circle of glory. They now pull forth
the serpent’s head repeatedly, and as often let it go, thus violently
whirling round the mountain, they churned the ocean,
for the recovery of the amrita, or beverage of immortality;
Vasoky serving as a rope to the mountain, which was supported
on the back of the tortoise. Presently there arose out of the
troubled deep, fourteen articles, usually called the fourteen
gems, or in common language <i>chowda ratny</i>.—1. The moon,
Chandra, with a pleasing countenance, shining with ten thousand
beams of gentle light;—2. Srī, or Lachhmī, the goddess of
fortune and beauty, whose seat is the white lily of the waters;—3.
Sura, wine; or Suradevi, the goddess of wine;—4. Oochisrava,
a horse with eight heads, and as swift as thought;—5.
Kustubha, a jewel of inestimable value, that glorious sparkling
gem worn by Narayen on his breast;—6. Parajata, the tree
of plenty, that spontaneously yielded every thing desired;—7.
Surabhi, a cow, similarly bountiful;—8. Dhanwantara, a physician;—9.
Iravat, the elephant of Indra with three proboscides;—10.
Shank, a shell conferring victory on whomsoever should
sound it;—11. Danashu, an unerring bow;—12. Bikh, poison,
or drugs;—13. Rhemba, the Aspara, a beautiful and amiable
woman;—14. Amrita, the beverage of immortality, which was
brought forth when the physician Dhanwantara appeared, holding
in his hand a white vessel filled with the immortal juice
Amrita.</p>

<h4>3. BARĀH OR VARĀHA, THE BOAR.</h4>

<p>I have a painting of this avatara, representing Vishnŭ in
human shape, with the head of a boar, on one of whose tusks
the earth is lifted up, which is represented as mountains; on
which is a Hindoo temple, with a flag. Vishnŭ himself is in
the ocean, his feet trampling on a gigantic demon who had
rolled up the earth into the form of a shapeless mass and
carried it down into the abyss, whither Vishnŭ followed him in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the shape of a boar, killed him with his tusks, and replaced the
earth in its original situation.</p>

<h4>4. NARA-SINGHA, OR THE MAN-LION.</h4>

<p>Hirinakassap, the younger brother of the gigantic demon,
who in the third avatar rolled up the earth and carried it down
to the abyss, succeeded him in his kingdom over the inferior
world, and refused to do homage to Vishnŭ. His son Pralhaud,
who disapproved of his father’s conduct, was persecuted and
banished; his father sought to kill him, but was prevented by
the interposition of heaven, which appeared on the side of
Pralhaud. At length, Hirinakassap was softened, and recalled
his son to his court; where, as he sat in full assembly, he began
to argue with him against the supremacy of Vishnŭ, boasted
that he himself was <i>lord of all the visible world</i>, and asked,
“What Vishnŭ could pretend to more?” Pralhaud replied,
“That Vishnŭ had no fixed abode, but was present every where.”
“Is he,” said his father, “in that pillar?” “Yes,” returned
Pralhaud. “Then let him come forth,” said the king; and
rising from his seat, struck the pillar with his foot; upon which
Vishnŭ, in the form of Nara-singha, that is to say, with a body
like a man, but a head like a lion, came out of the pillar and
tore Hirinakassap in pieces. Vishnŭ then fixed Pralhaud on
the throne, and his reign was a mild and virtuous one. I have
a Hindoo painting commemorative of this avatar, in which the
man-lion is represented seated in the centre of a pillar that has
been burst open, while, with his hands, he is tearing out the
bowels of the impious king, who lies howling and kicking across
the knees of Nara-singha. On the right of the picture a Hindūstanī
woman stands, with the palms of her hands pressed
together; and to the left, is a man, apparently a dwarf, standing
in the same attitude.</p>

<h4>5. VAMANA, OR THE DWARF.</h4>

<p>Maha-Beli, by severe religious austerities, had obtained from
Brahma the sovereignty of the universe, or the three regions of
the Sky, the Earth, and Patala. He was a generous and magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
monarch, but was so much elated by his grandeur, that he
omitted the essential ceremonies and offerings to the deities; and
Vishnŭ, finding it necessary to check the influence of such an
example, resolved to mortify and punish the arrogant Rājā. He
therefore assumed the form of a wretched <i>Brahmān</i> dwarf; and
appearing before the king, asked a boon, which being promised,
he demanded as much as he could pace in three steps: nor
would he desire further, although urged by Beli to demand
something more worthy of him to give. Vishnŭ, on obtaining
the king’s promise, required a ratification of it, which is performed
by the pouring out of water from a vessel upon the
hand of the person to whom it is given. The monarch,
although warned of the consequences, disdaining to deviate
from his word, confirmed his promise with the required oath;
and bidding the dwarf stretch forth his hand, poured out upon
it the sacred wave that ratified the promise. As the water in a
full stream descended from his extended hand, the form of the
Vamana gradually increased in magnitude, until it became of
such enormous dimensions that it reached up to heaven. Then,
with one stride, he measured the vast globe of the earth; with
the second, the ample expanse of heaven; and with the third,
was going to compass the regions of Patala; when Beli, convinced
that it was even Vishnŭ himself, fell prostrate and
adored him; yielding him up without farther exertion, the free
possessions of the third region of the universe. However,
Vishnŭ left Maha-Beli, for the remainder of his life, possession
of Patala, or the infernal regions. In this character Vishnŭ is
sometimes called the three-step-taker. I have an illuminated
painting of this avatar, in which the king, whose head is surrounded
with rays of glory, is holding in his hands a spouted
vessel, while just before him Vishnŭ in the character of a dwarf,
but with rays also around his head, is standing with clasped
hands. Behind the king an Hindūstanī woman is waving the
chaunrī, the white tail of the yak, above his head; and behind
the dwarf stands Sukra, called the one-eyed and evil counsellor.
The ratifying stream was the river Gunga, which, falling from
the hand of the dwarf Vishnŭ, descended thence to his foot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
whence, gushing as a mighty river, it was received on the head of
Shiva, and flowed on in the style commonly seen through the
cow’s mouth.</p>

<h4>6. PARASHU-RĀMA.</h4>

<p>The epithet parashu, distinguishingly prefixed to the name of
this Rāma, means a battle-axe. Among the avataras of Vishnŭ are
recorded three favoured personages, in whom the deity became incarnate,
all named Rāma,—Parashu-Rāma, Bala-Rāma, and Rāma-Chandra,
and who are all famed as great warriors, and as youths
of perfect beauty. Parashu-Rāma was born near Agra; his parents
were Jamadagni, whose name appears as one of the Rishis, and
Runeka. Jamadagni, in his pious retirement, was entrusted by
Indra with one of the fourteen gems of the ocean, the wonderful
boon-granting cow, Kam-dhenū or Surabhi; and on one occasion
he regaled the Raja Diruj, who was on a hunting party, in so
magnificent a manner as to excite his astonishment, until he
learned the secret of the inestimable animal possessed by his host.
Impelled by avarice, the cow was demanded from the holy
Brahmān; and, on refusal, he attempted to carry her away by
force, but the celestial cow, rushing on the Raja’s troops, gored
and trampled the greatest part of them, put the rest to flight,
and then, before them all, flew up triumphantly to heaven.
The enraged tyrant immediately marched another army to the
spot, and Kam-dhenū being no longer on earth to defend the
hermit, the holy man was massacred, and his hut razed to the
ground. Runeka, collecting together from the ruins whatever
was combustible, piled it in a heap, on which she placed her
husband’s mangled body; then, ascending it herself, set fire to it,
and was consumed to ashes. The prayers and imprecations of a
satī are never uttered in vain: ere she mounted the funeral pile,
to strengthen the potency of her imprecations on the Raja, she
performed also the ceremony of Naramedha, or the sacrifice of
a man; thereby rendering her solicitation to the avenging deities
absolutely irresistible.</p>

<p>Kam-dhenū, on her journey to Paradise, stopped to inform
Parashu-Rāma, who was under the care of Mahadēo, of the cruel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
conduct of the Raja to his parents; to whose aid he immediately
flew, but arrived only time enough to view the smoking
embers of the funeral pile. The tears rushed down his lovely
face, and he swore by the waters of the Ganges that he would
never rest until he had exterminated the whole race of the
Khettris, the raja-tribe of India. Armed with the invincible energy
of an incarnate god, he commenced his career of vengeance by
seeking and putting to death, with his single arm, the tyrant,
with all the forces that surrounded him; he then marched from
province to province, every where exerting the unerring bow
Dhanuk, and devoted the whole of the military race of Khettri
to death. After a life spent in mighty and holy deeds, Rāma
gave his whole property in alms, and retired to the Kokan,
where he is said to be still living on the Malabar coast.</p>

<p>I have an illuminated picture of this avatar representing a
single combat between Parashu-Rāma and the tyrant Diruj:
the Raja is represented with twenty-two arms, three of which,
having been cut off by Rāma, have fallen to the ground, the
remaining nineteen he is brandishing about. In the upper
part of the picture is represented the cell of the hermit, in front
of which Jamadagni lies dead, and the holy cow with golden
horns and golden wings is flying through the clouds.</p>

<h4>7. RĀMA-CHANDRA.</h4>

<p>Rāma-Chandra, son of Dasarathu, and conqueror of Lankā or
Ceylon, was the seventh avatar; when the deity descended for
the purpose of destroying Rāvana, who having obtained (for his
devotion) a promise from Brahma that he should not suffer
death by any of the usual means, was become the tyrant and pest
of mankind. The Devatās came in the shape of monkeys, as
Rāvana had gained no promise of safety from them; hence,
Hanumāna was Rāma’s general. Rāma-Chandra’s mother’s
name was Kaushalyā. His younger brother, Bharata, was son
of Kekayī, who was the cause of Rāma’s going to the desert to
perform devotions on the banks of the Pampa-nadī, insisting
that her son should reign the fourteen years that Rāma employed
in the devotion. It was while performing his devotion (or during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
his stay in the forests) in company with Lakshmana (his brother
by Sumitrā) that, while he was absent hunting, Rāvana
appeared as a beggar, and enticed away Sītā, which gave rise to
the war detailed in the Rāmayana. Sītā was daughter of Rājā
Janaka, who had promised to give her to any person who could
bend a certain bow, which was done by Rāma-Chandra. When
in the forest, he drew a circle round Sītā, and forbad her to go
beyond it, and left Lakshmana to take care of her; but Lakshmana
hearing some noise which alarmed him for his brother,
left her to seek him: then it was that Rāvana appeared, and
enticed her out of the circle (gandī), and carried her off in his
flying chariot. In the air Rāvana was opposed by the bird
Jatāgu, whose wings he cut and escaped. Rāma-Chandra reigned
in Awadh (Ayodhyā) before Christ 1600.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_108">Vol. I. page 108</a>, contains an account of the Ram Leela
Festival, and of Hŭnoomān and his army of monkeys, most
important personages in the history of Rāma-Chandra; the grief
of the warrior when roaming the world in search of the beloved
Sītā is described <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_342">Vol. I. page 342</a>. As the offspring of Shivŭ,
Hŭnoomān is sometimes represented five-headed. Sītā is described
as “endued with youth, beauty, sweetness, goodness,
and prudence; an inseparable attendant on her lord, as the light
on the moon; the beloved spouse of Rāma, dear as his own
soul, formed by the illusion of the <i>deva</i>; amiable, adorned with
every charm.” She is also a favourite in descriptive poetry, and
is held forth as an example of conjugal affection.</p>

<p>I have an illuminated picture of Sītā, Rām, and Hŭnoomān.
The happy pair are seated on a couch of silver and velvet, while
Hŭnoomān, on the ground before them, is gravely employed
shampooing one foot of the god; behind them stands an
attendant, waving a chaunrī of peacock’s feathers over their
heads.</p>

<h4>8. BALA-RĀMA.</h4>

<p>Bala-Rāma, although a warrior, may, from his attributes, be
esteemed a benefactor of mankind; for he bears a plough, and
a pestle for beating rice; and he has epithets derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
names of these implements, viz.: <i>Halayudha</i>, plough-armed;
and <i>Masali</i>, as bearing a musal or rice-beater. His name, <i>Bala</i>,
means strength, and he is sometimes seen with the skin of a lion
over his shoulders. A full account of the three Ramas is given
in the <i>Rāmayana</i>, a great epic poem, so highly venerated that
the fourth class of Hindūs, the Sudra, is not permitted to read
it. At the end of the first section, a promise is made of great
benefit to any individual of the first three tribes who shall duly
<i>read</i> that sacred poem:—“A <i>Brahman</i>, in reading it, acquires
learning and eloquence; a <i>Kshettria</i> will become a monarch;
a <i>Vaisya</i> will obtain vast commercial profits; and a <i>Sudra</i>,
<i>hearing</i> it, will become great.”</p>

<h4>9. BUDDHA.</h4>

<p>Such Hindūs as admit Buddha to be an incarnation of Vishnŭ
agree in his being the last important appearance of the deity on
earth; but many among the Brahmans and other tribes deny
their identity; and the Buddhists, countenanced by the <i>rahans</i>
their priests, do, in general, likewise assert the independent
existence, and, of course, paramount character, of the deity of
their exclusive worship.</p>

<p>Buddha opposed the sanguinary sacrifices of the Brahmans,
and consequently, in a degree, the holy vedas themselves which
enjoined them: in India, therefore, there has always been a sect
who are violently hostile to the followers of Buddha, denominating
them atheists, and denying the genuineness of his avatar.
A rock altar is sacred to him throughout Asia; and he himself
was often represented by a huge columnar black stone, black
being among the ancients a colour emblematical of the inscrutable
nature of the deity. His fame and the mild rites of his religion
have been widely diffused; the Indian Buddha is the Deva-Buddha
of the Japanese, whose history and superstitious rites
are detailed at great length by Kœmpfer: among other circumstances,
he relates, that, “in the reign of the eleventh Emperor
from Syn Mu, Budo came over from the Indies into Japan, and
brought with him, upon a <i>white horse, his religion and doctrine</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
I have an illuminated painting, which I purchased at Prāg,
representing Mahadēo as a black man, with a crown of glory,
leading a white horse, on which is a high native saddle, with a
large bag pendant from each side, and above the saddle an
umbrella (chatr), the emblem of royalty, and more especially
indicative of Buddha, is fixed: the legs of the animal are dyed
with menhdī up to the chest, and about a foot of the end of his
tail is also dyed red: the horse is ornamented in the usual
oriental style with jewellery and gold. It is evident that this is
not a painting of the tenth or Kalkī avatar, as the horse has
<i>no wings</i>; the saddle-bags, which, we may suppose, contain the
<i>doctrines which he brought with him upon a white horse</i>, and the
chatr, assign it to Buddha; the figure of the man has only two
arms.</p>

<p>“From the most ancient times,” says Abu’l Fazel, “down to
the present, the learning and wisdom of Hindūstan has been
confined to the Brahmans and the followers of Jaina; but,
ignorant of each other’s merits, they have a mutual aversion;
Krishna, whom the Brahmans worship as god, these consider as
an infernal slave; and the Brahmans carry their aversion so far
as to say, that it is better to encounter a mad elephant than to
meet a man of this persuasion.”</p>

<p>The Buddhism of Hindūstan appears formerly to have had its
central seat in Buddha Gaya, a town in Bengal, as it had at
Buddha Bamiyan, the northern metropolis of the sect. Ceylon
appears its present refuge. Buddhism is orthodoxy in China
and its tributary nations; and in the states and empires of
Cochin China, Cambodia, Siam, Pegu, Ava, Assam, Thibet,
Budtan, many of the Tartar tribes, and generally all parts east
of the Ganges, including many of those vast and numerous
islands in the seas eastward and southward of the farther <i>Indian</i>
promontory, whose inhabitants have not been converted to
Islamism.</p>

<p>Jayadeva, in the Gita Govinda, thus addresses Buddha (or
rather Vishnŭ or Krishna, so incarnated), in his series of eulogy
on each of the avatars:—“9. Thou blamest (O wonderful!) the
whole <i>veda</i>, when thou seest, O kind-hearted! the slaughter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
cattle prescribed for sacrifice.—O Kesava! assuming the body of
Buddha. Be victorious, O Heri, lord of the universe!”</p>

<p>The three sects of Jina, Mahiman, and Buddha, whatever
may be the difference between them, are all named Buddhas;
and as the chief law, in which, as the Brahmans assert, they
make virtue and religion consist, is to <i>preserve the lives of all
animated beings</i>, we cannot but suppose that the founder of their
sect was Buddha, in the ninth avatar, the benevolent, the tender-hearted.</p>

<p>Moor remarks:—“In very ancient sculptures and excavations
we find the image of Buddha among other deities of Brahmanical
superstition. The cave of Gharipuri, called by us Elephanta, an
island in Bombay Harbour, is an instance of this; and this
temple in itself may be called a complete pantheon; for among
the hundreds—I may, perhaps, say thousands—of figures there
sculptured, every principal deity is found. I noticed the following:
Brahma, Vishnŭ, Siva, Buddha, Ganesa, and Indra; and
these are, in fact, all that are, by their forms or attributes or
vehicles, unequivocally distinguishable. The figure of Buddha, in
the temple of Gharipuri, is immediately on your left at entering.”
Moor supposes the temple is dedicated to the One Supreme
Being; but as no representations are made of that being, his
three principal powers or attributes, Brahma, Vishnŭ, and Siva,
are united in the most conspicuous place, immediately fronting
the entrance, and forming a gigantic triune bust of the trimūrtī,
the Hindū triad. The native account of this avatar is, that
Buddha descended from the region of souls, and was incarnate
in the body of Mahamaya, the wife of the Raja of Kailas.
Five days after his birth, the <i>pandits</i> prophesied that, as he had
marks on his hands resembling a wheel, he would at length
become a Raja Chacraverti, and arrive at the dignity of avatar.
He was named Sacya, and on one occasion Brahma descended,
and held a <i>canopy</i> over his head. His wife was Vasutara, the
daughter of a Raja.</p>

<p>I have many images of Buddha, which were brought from
Ava, in gold, silver, and in bronze. The common posture is
that of sitting cross-legged on a throne, with his left hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
resting on his right foot, which is placed over his left knee, and
his right hand hanging over his right knee. I have two images
of Buddha in bronze, which came from Ava, in which he is represented
in this posture, sitting with his back against a plantain
tree, the leaves of which spread out above his head, and adorn the
image. These images were accompanied by several other figures
apparently engaged in worship, wearing high conical caps; the
hands of one figure are clasped in prayer; another holds in both
hands, placed upon the knees, a plate containing four balls; and
another, in the same attitude, holds in both hands something
that has the appearance of a circular box. I have also various
dragons and bells, formed of bronze, which also came from Ava.
An umbrella, made of iron, and gilt, is fixed on the tops of the
temples, round the border of which some persons suspend bells;
the sound has a pleasing effect when they are put in motion by
the wind. Bells of various size are sometimes hung near a temple;
and images of lions, and monsters of various descriptions, facing
the four quarters, or on each side the gateway, are attached to
most temples. Umbrellas, and stone-vessels, in imitation of those
used by Goutŭmŭ or Buddha as a mendicant, are also placed
near the places of worship. When Buddha was one month old,
his nurses “caused him to be laid under a white umbrella upon an
adorned pleasure-abounding bed.” At the age of sixteen, Buddha
practised the greatest austerities; the King, his father, became
alarmed and dejected; and the destiny-foretelling Brahmans assured
him, that unless he put the unfortunate horses to the unfortunate
chariot, and carried his son out, and buried him in a square
hole, that they perceived three evils might happen:—“One to
the King’s life, another to the white umbrella, another to the
Queen.” Buddha was carried forth; he manifested his divinity
to the driver of the unfortunate horses in the unfortunate
chariot, escaped from meditated death, and fixed himself as a
religious mendicant in the forest, where he practised the greatest
austerities. I have an illuminated painting of Mahadēo under a
rock in a jungle, seated upon a tiger’s skin, with his arms raised
above his head in penance. A sage leading a white horse stands
in front, in the act of worship, and by the side of the river is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
large tiger: and here it may be remarked, that, among works of
the highest merit, one is the feeding of an hungry infirm tiger
with a person’s own flesh, and the highest state of glory is
absorption. The following may explain the painting:—In the
midst of a wild and dreary forest, flourishing with trees of sweet-scented
flowers, and abounding in fruits and roots, infested with
lions and tigers, destitute of human society, and frequented by
the <i>munis</i> (virtuous and mighty sages), resided Buddha, the
author of happiness, and a portion of Narayana. Once upon a
time, the illustrious Amara, renowned amongst men, coming
here, discovered the place of the Supreme Being in the great
forest. He caused an image of the supreme spirit Buddha to be
made, and he worshipped it as the incarnation of a portion of
Vishnŭ: “Reverence be unto thee, in the form of Buddha;—thou
art he who rested upon the face of the milky ocean, and
who lieth upon the serpent Sesha; thou art Trivikrama, who at
three strides encompassed the earth. I adore thee, who art
celebrated by a thousand names, and under various forms, in the
shape of Buddha, the god of mercy.” The illustrious Amara-Deva
then built the holy temple of Buddha Gaya, and set up
the divine foot of Vishnŭ.</p>

<p>“The forefathers of him who shall perform a sradda (funeral
obsequies in honour of ancestors) at this place, shall obtain salvation;
a crime of an hundred-fold shall be expiated by a sight
thereof; of a thousand-fold, by a touch thereof; and of a hundred
thousand-fold, from worshipping thereof.”</p>

<p>The image of white marble, which the mūnshī at Allahabad
informed me is that of Parisnāth, see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_324">Vol. i. p. 324</a>, is six inches
high; the position differs slightly from that of Buddha, the
right palm is laid over the left, and the soles of the feet are
shown, one on each side the hands; the head is raised conically;
the hair is straight on the crown, and the woolly portion is so
managed as to resemble a fillet of beads round the temple. A
raised and quadrated lozenge is on the breast, and in the palm
of the hand is a small ball. In the centre of the pedestal on
which the image is seated is a crescent. The lobes of the ears are
elongated to reach the shoulders. Moor informs us that in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
museum at the India House, is an image “about fourteen inches
high, of a whitish, and I think calcareous, sort of stone: an
inscription is on the pedestal, under the crescent, but it is not
easily to be made out or copied. This image is, I think, of a
very singular and curious description: its curly hair, thick lips,
and position mark it decidedly of <i>Buddhaic</i> origin, while its
seven heads refer it to a sect of <i>Sauras</i>: hence the appellation
of Surya Buddha, appropriately applied to it. The quadrated
lozenge on the breast and in the palm of this image, is also
unaccounted for, and singular.”</p>

<p>The image of Parisnāth agrees perfectly with the above
description, with the exception that it has only one head, and
there is no inscription on the pedestal.</p>

<p>Buddha signifies a <i>wise man</i>, and sacya, his other title, means
a <i>feeder upon vegetables</i>; he inculcated a total subjugation of
sense, and an utter annihilation of <i>passion</i>. According to the
religion of Buddha, there are no distinctions of caste. Polygamy
is not forbidden by the Buddha doctrine, and it is not
uncommon for a man to have a plurality of wives. Priests are
forbidden to marry; they are to live by mendicity; are to
possess only three garments, a begging dish, a girdle, a razor,
a needle, and a cloth to strain the water which they drink,
that they may not devour insects. To account for the short,
crisp hair on the head of the idol, resembling that of an African,
it is said that Buddha, on a certain occasion, cut his hair
with a golden sword, and its appearance in consequence was
meant to be represented on his images.</p>

<p>There is a tradition among the Cingalese, that one of the
kings of Hindūstan, immediately after Buddha’s death, collected
together five hundred learned ascetics, and persuaded them to
write down on palmyra leaves, from the mouth of one of
Buddha’s principal disciples, all the doctrines taught by Buddha
in his lifetime. The Cingalese admit they received their religion
from the hands of a stranger. The Burmans believe that
a Brahman was deputed to Ceylon to copy the histories of the
incarnations of Buddha; and it is fabled that the iron stile
with which he copied this work, was given him by an heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
messenger. With the images of Buddha from Ava, were also
presented to me four leaves of the palmyra-tree, twenty-three
inches in length by two and a half in breadth, on both sides of
which are engraved with a stile the religious doctrines of the
Burmese. The leaves are held together by two pieces of ribbon
passed through holes in them, and are a portion of a work of
about three or four inches in thickness. In the plate entitled
“<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#plate07">Pūja of the Tūlsī</a>,” the Brahman is reading from palmyra
leaves of the same description.</p>

<h4>10. KALKĪ, OR THE HORSE.</h4>

<p>The Kalkī, or final avatar, is yet to come; in which Vishnŭ
will appear incarnate in a human form, for the purpose of dissolving
the universe. The Kalkī will be incarnate in the
house of the Brahman Bishenjun, the apparent offspring of the
sage by his wife Awejsedenee, and will be born in the city of
Sambal, towards the close of the Kalī period or Yug, in the
month Vaisach, the scorpion. In one hand he is represented
bearing aloft a “cimetar, blazing like a comet,” to destroy all
the impure, who shall then inhabit the earth; and in the other
he displays a circular ornament or ring, the emblem of cycles
perpetually revolving, and of which the existing one is on the
point of being finally terminated. The Kalkī is represented
leading a <i>white horse</i>, richly caparisoned, adorned with jewels,
and furnished with <i>wings</i>. The horse is represented standing on
three feet only, holding up, without intermission, the right fore-leg;
with which, say the Brahmans, when he stamps with fury
upon the earth, the present period shall close, and the dissolution
of nature take place. Jayadeva thus describes the tenth avatar:
“For the destruction of all the impure thou drawest thy
cimetar, blazing like a comet: (how tremendous!) O Kesava,
assuming the body of Kalkī: Be victorious, O Heri, lord of the
universe!”</p>

<p>End of the Kalī-yug, or fourth Indian period, and of the
history of the ten avatars.</p>

<h3>THE DESCENT OF VISHNŬ AS KRISHNA.</h3>

<p>The Preserver appeared on earth in the form of Krishna,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
who is regarded as Vishnŭ himself, and distinct from the ten
avatars. For the history of this god I refer you to <a href="#Page_118">page 118</a>,
in which, under the title of Krishnŭ, or Kaniya, is given the
history of his life, up to the time that he disappeared from
amidst the gopīs, and left them mourning for his absence.</p>

<p>Here, it may be as well to remark, in consequence of an error
in that part of my journal, that Dewarkī, the mother of Krishnŭ,
was the daughter of the tyrant Kansa; and that Vasudeva, who
carried him across the Jumna, was his <i>father</i>.</p>

<p>The death of Krishna, which happened some time afterwards,
and his ascension to the heavens, is thus related:—“Balhadur
met his fate on the banks of the Jumna, and when Krishna saw
that his spirit had finally departed, he became exceedingly
sorrowful. Near where he stood there was a jungle or brake,
into which he entered; and leaning his head on his knees, sat
absorbed in the deepest melancholy. He reflected within himself
that all the effect of Kanharee’s curse had now fully taken
place on the Yadavas, and he now called to remembrance these
prophetic words, which Doorsava had once uttered to him:—‘O
Krishna! take care of the <i>sole of thy foot</i>; for if any evil
come upon thee, it will happen in that place.’ Krishna then
said to himself, ‘Since all the Kooroos and the whole of the
Yadavas are now dead and perished, it is time for me also to
quit the world.’ Then, leaning on one side, and placing his
feet over his thighs, he summoned up the whole force of his
mental and corporeal powers, while his hovering spirit stood
ready to depart. At that time, there came thither a hunter,
with his bow and arrow in his hand; and seeing from a distance
Krishna’s foot, which he had laid over his thigh, and which was
partly obscured by the trees, he suspected it to be some animal
sitting there: applying, therefore, to his bow and arrow, the point
of the latter of which was formed from the <i>very iron of that club</i>
which had issued from Sateebe’s body, he took aim, and struck
Krishna <i>in the sole of his foot</i>. Then, thinking he had secured
the animal, he ran up to seize it; when, to his astonishment,
he beheld Krishna there, with four hands, and drest in yellow
habiliments. When the hunter saw that the wounded object<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
was Krishna, he advanced, and, falling at his feet, said, ‘Alas,
O Krishna! I have, by the most fatal of mistakes, struck you
with this arrow; seeing your foot at a distance, I did not
properly discern my object, but thought it to be an animal; Oh,
pardon my involuntary crime!’ Krishna comforted him to the
utmost of his power, saying, ‘It was no fault of thine; depart,
therefore, in peace.’ The hunter then humbly kissed his foot,
and went sorrowing away. After the hunter was gone, so great
a light proceeded from Krishna, that it enveloped the whole
compass of the earth, and illuminated all the expanse of heaven.
At that instant, an innumerable tribe of devatas, and other
celestial beings, of all ranks and denominations, came to meet
Krishna; and he, luminous as on that night when he was born
in the house of Vasudeva, by that same light pursued his journey
between heaven and earth, to the bright Vaikontha or Paradise,
whence he had descended. All this assemblage of beings, who
had come to meet Krishna, exerted the utmost of their power
to laud and glorify him. Krishna soon arrived at the abode of
Indra, who was overjoyed to behold him, accompanied him
as far as Indra-Loke reached, and offered him all manner
of ceremonious observances. When Krishna had passed
the limits of Indra’s territory, Indra said to him, ‘I have
no power to proceed any farther, nor is there any admission
for me beyond this limit;’ so Krishna kindly dismissed him,
and went forward alone.”</p>

<p>Arjoon, the friend of Krishna, went to Dwaraka, to see in
what state Krishna himself might be; when he beheld <i>the city
in the state of a woman whose husband is recently dead</i>; and
finding neither Krishna nor Balhadur nor any other of his
friends there, the whole place appeared in his eyes as if involved
in a cloud of impenetrable darkness; nor could he refrain from
bursting into tears. The sixteen thousand wives of Krishna,
the moment they set their eyes on Arjoon, burst also into a flood
of tears, and all at once began the most bitter lamentations;
and, in truth, the whole city was so rent with uproar and
distraction, that it surpasses description. A few days from this
time, Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, died, while fourteen of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
his wives were standing around him, four of whom burnt themselves
on his funeral pile. Arjoon made search also for the
earthly portions of what once was Krishna and Balhadur: these
also he solemnly committed to the flames. Five of Krishna’s
wives burnt themselves; while Sete-Bame, with some others,
investing themselves with the habits of Sanyassi’s, and, forsaking
the world, retired into the deserts to pass their lives in solitude
and prayer.</p>

<p>Of the eight wives of Krishna it is unnecessary to give a
detailed account; the history of Radha has been mentioned
before, but Rukmeni must not be forgotten, who, with several
other of his wives, became satī, in the hope of an immediate
reunion with her lord in the heaven of Vaikontha.</p>

<h3>KAMA-DEVA, THE GOD OF LOVE.</h3>

<p>Rukmeni bore to Krishna a son, who was named Pradyamna,
and was no other than Kama, the God of Love. He was stolen
by Sambara, a Rājā, cast into the sea, and swallowed by a fish;
which being caught and presented to the Rājā, was opened by
his cook, Reti, who discovered and preserved the child. A
talisman was given which rendered the infant invisible at pleasure.
He was nurtured by Kam-dhenū, the holy cow, one of
the fourteen gems of the ocean. The god of Love attained manhood,
and delusion (maya) being removed, he was restored to
his delighted mother, Rukmeni.</p>

<p>He is represented as a beautiful youth, sometimes conversing
with his mother and consort in the midst of his gardens
and temples; sometimes riding by moonlight on a parrot or
lory, and attended by dancing girls or nymphs, the foremost of
whom bears his banner, a fish on a red ground. His favourite
place of resort was a tract of country around Agra, and the
plains of Matra; where Krishna also, and the Gopia, usually
spent the night singing and dancing. Pushpa-dhanva, the god
with the flowery bow, is one of his many appellations. His bow
is represented of flowers, or of sugar-cane, with a string formed
of bees, and his five arrows, each pointed with an Indian
blossom of love-inspiring quality.</p>

<p>“Hail, god of the flowery bow; hail, warrior, with a fish on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
thy banner; hail, powerful divinity, who causest the firmness
of the sage to forsake him, and subduest the guardian deities of
the eight regions!</p>

<p>“Glory be to Madana; to Kama; to him who is formed as
the god of gods; to him by whom Brahma, Vishnŭ, Siva,
Indra, are filled with emotions of rapture!”</p>

<h3>JAGANA’TH, OR JAGANAT’HA.</h3>

<p>On the festival of the Rat’ha-jattra, or the festival of the
Chariot, the images of Krishna and Bala-Rāma are borne about in
a car by day: on this occasion Krishna is worshipped as Jagana’th,
or Lord of the Universe. At the temple of that name the
concourse of people is very great: the rising of the moon is the
sign of the commencement of the feast, which must end when
it sets. A legend is given of Krishna having hid himself in the
moon, in consequence of a false accusation of stealing a gem
from Prasena, who had been killed by a lion. To see the moon
on the fourth day after full, and the fourth day after new, of
the month Bhadra, is hence deemed inauspicious; and is consequently
avoided by pious Vaishnavus, or followers of Vishnŭ.
Further particulars relative to this deity will be found in the
chapter that records my visit to the far-famed temple of
Jagana’th.</p>

<p>Having thus traced Vishnŭ the Preserver through the various
forms he assumed on earth in the ten avatars, in his appearance
as Krishna, and the latter in the form of Jaganat’ha, let us
return to the third personage of the Hindū triad.</p>

<h3>SHIVŬ, THE DESTROYER.</h3>

<p>This god is generally ranked as the third power or attribute
of the deity, he personifies destruction; and in the obvious
arrangement of the three grand powers of the Eternal One,
Creation and Preservation precede Destruction. His most usual
accompaniment is a trident, or tri-forked flame, called trisula; his
colour is white, that of his hair light or reddish. He is sometimes
seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten;
and with five faces. He has a third eye in his forehead, <i>pointing
up and down</i>; this distinction is peculiar to him, his children, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Avataras. As the god of Justice, which character he shares
with Yama and other deities, he rides a bull, the symbol of
divine justice. As emblems of immortality, serpents are common
to many deities, but this god is abundantly decked with
them, and snakes are his constant attendants. A crescent on
his forehead, or in his hair, is common in pictures and images
of Mahadeva or Shivŭ. Serpents, emblems of eternity, form his
ear-rings, called Naug Kundala: his pendant collar of human
heads (Mund mala) marks his character of Destruction, or Time;
and his frontal crescent points at its most obvious measurement,
by the phases of the moon. He holds what has been considered
as a small double hand-drum, shaped like an hour-glass, called
<i>damaru</i>, probably a sand <i>gheri</i>. Shivŭ is called “the three-eyed
god,” and “the auspicious deity with uneven eyes.” Sometimes
he is represented with a battle-axe (gadha, or parasha), and
an antelope (<i>mirg</i>) in his superior hands: and in many plates of
the deity his loins are wrapped in a tiger’s skin, and the goddess
Gunga (the Ganges) flows from his <i>mugut</i> or head-piece. The
followers of Vishnŭ assert, that the blessed river flowed originally
out of heaven, from the foot of Vishnŭ, and, descending
upon Kailasa, the terrestrial paradise of Mahadēo, fell on the
head of Shivŭ. Each sect is desirous of tracing the source of
the sacred river to the head or foot of its own deity. The
stream is sometimes seen issuing from the head of Shivŭ, and
sometimes she afterwards issues from a cow’s mouth. It is
said, that high up towards its source the river passes through a
narrow rocky passage, which pilgrims, who visit the sacred cleft,
imagine resembles a <i>cow’s mouth</i>. This spot is hence called
<i>Gawmuki</i>, and is a place greatly resorted to by pilgrims.</p>

<p>Viswaswara is the name by which Shivŭ is invoked at a
beautiful and famous temple of that name in Kashi, or Benares;
and it is said in the <i>Purānas</i>, that “The <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Shastrs</i> all
testify that Viswaswara is the first of <i>Devas</i>, Kashi the first of
cities, Gunga the first of rivers, and charity the first of virtues.”
Nandi is the epithet always given to the vehicle of Siva, the
white bull: in his temples it is usually represented <i>couchant</i>.</p>

<p>Here I will mention some of the animals appropriated as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
vehicles to Hindū mythological personages. Brahma, the swan,
<i>Hanasa</i>—Vishnŭ, the eagle, <i>Garuda</i>—Shivŭ, the bull, <i>Nandi</i>—Ganesh,
the rat—Kartikeya, a peacock—Indra, the elephant,
<i>Travati</i>—Varuna, the genius of the waters, bestrides a fish, as
doth also Gunga, the prime goddess of rivers. Kama, the god
of Love, is carried by a lory, or parrot; Agni, god of Fire,
by a ram. The Sactī, or consorts of these deities, have the
attendant animal or vahan of their respective lords. Bhavani
is, however, oftener seen on a lion or a tiger than on a bull, the
vahan of Shivŭ. Avataras of deities ride a bull, horse, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of Garuda, the man-eagle or bird-god, I have a small and
curious brazen image; representing him with folded wings,
sitting in an attitude of adoration, on the back of a nondescript
animal, which I have been told is a rhinoceros, but it has no
horn.</p>

<p>Another brazen image which I procured, as well as the former,
at Prāg, represents the bird-god in an attitude of adoration on
one knee, supporting on the top of his head a broadly-expanded
cup, edged with leaves, perhaps intended to represent an expanded
lotus; a vessel of this sort is used in pūja.</p>

<p>The title <i>deva</i> is very comprehensive, meaning generally a
deity; devī is its feminine, but it is applied mostly to Bhavani,
consort of Mahadeva, which name of Shivŭ is, literally, great
god. But, as the title of <i>deva</i> is given to other gods, superior
and inferior, so that of <i>devī</i> is, as hath been before stated,
occasionally bestowed similarly on other goddesses. Devata is
the plural of deva; by some writers spelled dewtah.</p>

<p>The antelope (<i>mirg</i>) that Shivŭ holds in one hand, alludes to
a sacrifice, when the deer, fleeing from the sacrificial knife, took
refuge with him. Five lighted lamps are used in pūja to this
god.</p>

<p>Dūrgā is the consort of Shivŭ; this goddess is also known
under the name of Bhŭgŭvŭtēē, which title is also given to the
cow, which is regarded by the Hindūs as a form of Dūrgā. He
was also married to Satī, the daughter of King Dukshu.</p>

<p>Mahā-kāla is another form in which Shivŭ is worshipped in
the character of the destroying deity. The image is of a smoke-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
boy, with three eyes, clothed in red garments. His
hair stands erect; his teeth are very large; he wears a necklace
of human skulls, and a large turban of his own hair; in one
hand he holds a stick, and in another the foot of a charpāī;
his body is swollen, and his appearance terrific. Images of this
form of Shivŭ are not made in Bengal, but a pan of water, or
an emblem of Mahadēo, are substituted; before which bloody
sacrifices are offered. Except before this image, such sacrifices
are never offered to Shivŭ.</p>

<h3>MAHADÉO, OR MAHĀ-DEVA.</h3>

<p>Shivŭ appeared on earth in the form of a naked mendicant,
with one head, two arms, and three eyes, and was acknowledged
as Mahadēo, the great god: when he was about to be married
to Pārvatī, the daughter of the Himalaya, her friends treated
the god in a scurrilous manner, and cried out, “Ah! ah! ah!
this image of gold, this most beautiful damsel, the greatest
beauty in the three worlds, to be given in marriage to such a
fellow,—an old fellow, with three eyes, without teeth, clothed in
a tiger’s skin, covered with ashes, encircled with snakes;
wearing a necklace of human bones; with a human skull in his
hand; with a filthy jŭta—that is, hair matted about his head in
form of a tiara; who chews intoxicating drugs, has inflamed
eyes, rides naked on a bull, and wanders about like a madman.
Ah! they have thrown this beautiful daughter into the river!”
The <i>asoca</i> is a shrub consecrated to Mahadēo, and is planted
near his temples. The <i>biloa</i>, otherwise called <i>Malura</i>, is also
sacred to him; he alone wears a chaplet of its flowers, and they
are offered in sacrifice to no other deity; and if a pious Hindū
should see any of its flowers fallen on the ground, he would
remove them reverently to a temple of Mahadēo. The Hindū
poets call it Srīphul, the flower of Srī.</p>

<p>I have a beautiful image in white marble, highly gilt and
ornamented, representing Mahadēo as a white man, young and
handsome, sitting on a platform, with Pārvatī on his left knee.
His hair is braided into the shape of a conical turban around his
head, about which a serpent is twisted; and from the top of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
head flows Gunga, in a heavy stream, to the ground. His
moustache is brilliantly jet black, and his forehead adorned with
the triple eye in the centre of a crescent. Below Mahadēo in the
centre of the platform, is a small image of his son Ganesh, on
whose right is the Nandi, the white bull <i>couchant</i>, and on his left,
below Pārvatī, is a yellow tiger. Mahadēo is represented with
four hands, one bearing the tri-forked flame, another a warlike
weapon, a third a short rosary of beads, the fourth, the hand-drum,
the form of which is like an hour-glass. His hands and
feet are dyed with hinnā; his dress is yellow; a large snake is
around his neck, and his body profusely adorned with jewels.</p>

<h3>GANESH.</h3>

<p>The history of Ganesh, the son of Mahadēo and Pārvatī,
having been fully detailed in the Introduction, is here omitted.
This god is the guardian to the entrance of the heaven of Shivŭ.
Vishnŭ, in the form of Parashu-Rāma, wished to have an
interview with Shivŭ, which was denied him by Ganesh; upon
which a battle ensued, and Parashu-Rāma tore out one of his
tusks. No public festivals are held in honour of Ganesh in
Bengal; many persons, however, choose him as their guardian
deity. Stone images of Ganesh are worshipped daily in the
temples by the side of the Ganges, at Benares, and at Allahabad.</p>

<h3>KARTIKEYA.</h3>

<p>The second son of Mahadēo and Pārvatī is the god of war,
and commander of the celestial armies; he is represented as
six-headed, six-armed, six-mothered, and sometimes riding a
peacock.</p>

<p>An account of the three great gods of the Hindū triad having
been given, I will add a short description of the three principal
goddesses, Lachhmī, Saraswatī, and Dūrga.</p>

<h3>LACHHMĪ.</h3>

<p>This goddess is the consort of Vishnŭ, and is esteemed by his
followers as the mother of the world. When the sea was being
agitated for the production of the immortal beverage, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
fourteen gems of the ocean; “after a long time appeared the great
goddess, inhabiting the lotus, clothed with superlative beauty,
in the first bloom of youth, covered with ornaments, and bearing
every auspicious sign; adorned with a crown, with bracelets on
her arms, her jetty locks flowing in ringlets, and her body,
which resembled burning gold, adorned with ornaments of pearl.
This great goddess appeared with four arms, holding a lotus in
her hand; her countenance of incomparable beauty. Thus was
produced the goddess Padma or Srī, adored by the whole universe;
Padma by name. She took up her abode in the bosom
of Padma-nabha, even of Heri.” <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_206">Vol. I. page 206</a>, is an
account and a sketch of this goddess of beauty and of prosperity.
I have a very ancient and time-worn brazen image,
representing Lachhmī seated on an elephant; she has four
hands, the two superior hands are raised as high as her head;
one holds a lotus-bud, the other something not unlike one;
each hand also supports an elephant; their trunks unite above
her head, and from two water-vessels they are pouring water on
an emblem of Mahadēo, which rests on the crown of the head
of the goddess. The lower hands are empty, the palm of one
is raised, the other turned downwards. This image is very
ancient and most singular: she is the goddess who presides over
marriage, and, as the deity of prosperity, is invoked also for
increase of children, especially male children. She bears the
title of Rembha, as the sea-born goddess of beauty.</p>

<p>Moor gives a drawing, much resembling the above, of a cast
in brass, which he considers to be Devi, <i>the goddess</i>, a form of
Durgā.</p>

<h3>SARASWATĪ.</h3>

<p>Saraswatī, the daughter of Brahma, and wife of Vishnŭ, is
represented as a white woman, playing on a sitar. She is adored
as the patroness of the fine arts, especially music and rhetoric;
as the inventress of the Sanscrit language, of the Devanagry
character, and of the sciences which writing perpetuates. This
goddess was turned into a river by the curse of a Brahman, and,
at the Trivenī, the river Saraswatī is supposed to join the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Ganges and Jumna underground. On the 5th day of the month
Magha, Saraswatī or Srī, the goddess of arts and eloquence, is
worshipped with offerings of flowers, perfumes, and dressed rice:
the worship is performed before her image, or a pen, inkstand,
and book; the latter articles are supposed to form a proper
substitute for the goddess. On this day the Hindūs neither
read nor write, it is the command of the shastr. Implements of
writing, and books, are treated with respect, and are not used on
this holiday. Of an eloquent man the Hindūs say, “Saraswatī
sits on his tongue.”</p>

<p>I have a picture of the goddess of eloquence, having an interview
with Ganesh, the patron of literature; with whom she is
exchanging written scrolls, probably the vedas. Saraswatī is
mounted, astride, upon a most singular looking bird; it is not a
swan, neither is it a peacock; its legs are long, so is its neck;
it is painted red; can it be intended for the sarasŭ, what we call
cyrus, or Siberian crane? In one of her superior hands she
bears the vina, or been, a musical instrument; in the second is a
lotus and a scroll of paper with writing upon it; the other two
hands also bear written scrolls. She is represented as a white
woman, with one head, on which is a red and yellow coronet;
her attire is of various colours, and she is adorned with jewellery,
as well as with a long string or garland of flowers. Ganesh is
represented sitting on a lotus, and standing behind him is a
woman employed in fanning him with a chaunrī, made of the
white tail of the yak; the black rat, the constant attendant of
Ganesh, is sitting before him.</p>

<h3>DŪRGA.</h3>

<p>The consort of Shivŭ derives her name from the giant
Doorgŭ, whom she slew. A short account of the Dasera, a
festival held in honour of this goddess, has been given in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_34">Vol. I.
p. 34</a>. Dūrga has a thousand names, and has assumed innumerable
forms, among which are Kalī, the black goddess,
worshipped at Kalī Ghat; Bhŭvanī, the wife of Shivŭ; Pārvutī,
the Daughter of the Mountain; the Inaccessible, the Terrible,
the Mother of the Universe. Kalī, under the name of Phŭlŭ-Hŭrēē,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
is described in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_164">Vol. I. p. 164</a>; and Dūrga, as Bhagwan,
will be hereafter mentioned. I have an ancient and curious
brazen image of Dūrga, with ten arms, which I procured at
Prāg. Also numerous images of Anna-Purna Devi, the goddess
who fills with food, a very common household deity; most
families in the Mahratta country include her among their Dii
penates. She is represented as a woman sitting cross-legged,
and holding a spoon with both hands across her lap.</p>

<p>Pārvatī, Bhavani, Dūrga, Kali, and Devi, or <i>the Goddess</i>, are
names used almost indiscriminately in the writings and conversations
of the Hindūs. The history of Satī has been given
in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_94">Vol. I. p. 94</a>.</p>

<h3>THE PURĀNAS.</h3>

<p>The first Indian poet was Valmiki, author of the Ramayana, a
complete epic poem; and Vyasa, the next in celebrity, composed
the Mahabarat. To him are ascribed the sacred Purānas,
which are called for their excellence, <i>the Eighteen</i>: they comprise
the whole body of Hindū Theology; and each Purāna
treats of five topics especially; <i>i.e.</i> the creation, the destruction,
and renovation of the worlds; the genealogy of gods and
heroes; the reigns of the Manus; and the transactions of
their descendants. The Purānas are, 1. Brŭmhŭ; 2. Padma,
or the Lotus; 3. Brahmānda, or the egg of Brahmā, the Hindū
Mundane egg; 4. Agni, or fire; 5. Vishnŭ; 6. Garuda, the
bird god, the vehicle of Vishnŭ; 7. Brahmavaivartā, or transformation
of Brahmŭ; 8. Shivŭ; 9. Linga; 10. Naruda, son of
Brahma; 11. Skanda, son of Shivŭ; 12. Mārkendeya, so called
from a sage of that name; 13. Bhavishyat, future or prophetic;
14. Matsya, or the fish; 15. Varāha, or the boar;
16. Kūrma, or the tortoise; 17. Vāmaha, or the dwarf; and
18. The Bhāgavat, or life of Krishnŭ. The Purānas are reckoned
to contain four hundred thousand stanzas. There are, also,
eighteen upapurānas, or similar poems of inferior sanctity and
different appellations; the whole constituting the popular or
poetical creed of the Hindūs, and some of them, or particular
parts of them, being very generally read and studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>On the ancient sculptures and medals, allusive to the cosmogony,
these hieroglyphic symbols, the egg and the serpent,
perpetually occur in very great variety, single and combined;
that famous representation of the Mundane egg, encompassed
by the folds of the Agathodaimon, or good serpent, and suspended
aloft in the temple of Hercules at Tyre, is well known
to antiquaries. The Deus lunatus ovatus Heliopolitanus, or the
divine egg with the lunar crescent, adored at Heliopolis, in
Syria, is another relic of this ancient superstition. The most
remarkable, however, of these symbolical devices is that erected,
and at this day to be seen in one of the temples of Japan.
The temple itself, in which this fine monument of oriental
genius is elevated, is called Daibod, and stands in Meaco, a
great and flourishing city of Japan. The principal image in this
design displays itself in the form of a vast bull, butting with its
horns against the egg, which floated on the waters of the abyss.
The statue of the bull itself is formed of massy gold, with a
great knob on its back, and a golden collar about its neck,
embossed with precious stones. The fore-feet of the animal
are represented as resting on that egg, and his hinder feet are
immersed amidst stone and earth mixed together, the symbol of
a chaotic mass, under which and the egg appears a considerable
quantity of water, kept in a hollow stone. The basis of the
whole is a square altar, the foot of which is engraved with many
ancient Japanese characters; and round that foot, in M. D’Hancarville’s
engraving, are two natives of that country prostrate,
and adoring it.</p>

<h3>THE VEDAS.</h3>

<p>The Hindūs believe that the original veda was revealed by
Brahma, and was preserved by tradition until it was arranged
in its present form by a sage, who thence obtained the
name of Vyasa, or Veda-vyasa; that is, <i>compiler</i> of the <i>vedas</i>.
He distributed the Indian scriptures into four parts, each of
which bears the common denomination of veda. The <i>veda</i>,
collectively, is the body of Hindū scripture. The most popular
idea of their origin is, that they (the four vedas) issued from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the four mouths of Brahma. Brahma, as we have seen, had
once five heads; and there is a supplement to the Hindū scriptures,
which some affirm to constitute a fifth veda. A mysterious
set of books, called Agama, proceeded from the mouth
of Shivŭ.</p>

<p>In Ceylon is a high mountain, on which is the print of a foot,
still visible; the natives worship this sacred footstep as that of
the god Buddha, who from that eminence ascended to his native
skies.</p>

<p>It has been offered, as a probable conjecture, that the Buddha
superstition was the ancient religion of India, and that the
followers of Buddha were driven out of Hindūstan by the
superior interest of the Brahmans at the courts of the Hindū
monarchs. The priests of Buddha insist that the Brahmans
came with their religion from <i>Egypt</i>; while, by others, it is conversely
maintained that the <i>Egyptians</i> derived their doctrines and
science from <i>India</i>. The religion of Buddha was, heretofore,
and probably also about the era of Christianity, indisputably of
extensive prevalence, as is evinced by many stupendous monuments.
In Ava, where Buddhism is orthodoxy, the idea is
upheld that it was equally prevalent in the same form throughout
India until about the second century before Christ, when the
Brahmans are stated to have introduced themselves and their
rites.</p>

<p>This short account of the Hindū triad and their incarnations
will give some idea of the mythology of the Hindūs; but to
understand the subject more fully it would be necessary to refer
to the authorities I have quoted in this abstract<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>1838, <i>Jan. 8th.</i>—Arrived at Jellalabad without any adventures.
Went to hear the band in the evening, but felt weary from not
having slept the night before on account of the yells of the
packs of jackals in every direction round the tent, and the noise
of the sentries keeping off the people from Kanauj. We were
in a complete jangal: a wolf came up to my tent at mid-day,
then trotting over to the opposite tent, carried off my neighbour’s
kid.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Early this morning I overtook Colonel M⸺, who
was marching with his regiment, and rode with him some miles:
we passed over a most curiously built suspension bridge, thrown
over the Kala-nadī by the late Nawab Hakīm Menhdī; the
pillars through which some part of the workmanship passes
are remarkable. The sight of the river put me in mind of the
excellence and large size of the <i>arwarī</i> fish it contains. Afterwards,
speaking of this sort of mullet to Captain O⸺, he
told me he had sent out a man to shoot <i>arwarī</i> fish, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
returned quite sick from having seen a hundred and thirty dead
bodies choking up the river.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Arrived at Fathīgarh.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—Dined with Major Sutherland, the Resident of Gwalior,
who was in attendance on the Governor-General. A number of
friends were assembled; a bright fire blazed in the tent; our
host was the life of the party; the dinner was excellent. I
have seldom passed a more agreeable evening.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Crossed the river on a bridge of boats that had been
erected for the accommodation of the Lord Sāhib, as the natives
call the Governor-General.</p>

<p>They say there are about eleven thousand people with the
camp, and elephants and camels innumerable, which, added to the
Body guard, Artillery, and Infantry, form an immense multitude.
It is said his Lordship’s marching about the country costs the Government
70,000 rupees a month; the encampment encroaching
on fields of grain often costs from 300 to 400 rupees a day to
make up the loss sustained by the peasants. On the other side
the bridge, the road was marked out by little flags,—and a most
heartbreaking road it was; entirely through the dry bed of the
river, nearly axle deep in fine sand: the day was bitterly cold,
the wind very high, and the flying sand filled our eyes and
mouths. I was too unwell to mount my horse, and the result
was that the two greys had to drag me the whole way in the
Stanhope. The first thing I discovered was my ayha in her cart
fixed in the sand, and quite immovable. Some soldiers came
forward and helped her out of her difficulty. All the Company’s
hackeries had come to an anchor. The soldiers, finding the
bullocks had no power to extricate them from the sand, took out
the animals, and harnessed themselves, some thirty or forty men
to each cart, and dragged it until it reached better ground.</p>

<p>I came up to my tent at Imrutpūr, and found it was pitched
close to the lines of the camp of the Governor-General; this
could not be altered at the time, the other tent not having
come up, and being ill I laid down to rest. The other tent
did not come up until it was too late to pitch it; and in the
evening I was annoyed at finding I was within the rules of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
camp, within the sentries, which I had given strict orders to
avoid, and which my people had disobeyed by mistake when
pitching the tent during the night. Indeed, the long march
over the sand of the river had harassed them, and when it is
particularly cold, the natives are more stupid than usual.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—I was quite ill, and much inclined to give up my
journey altogether, but as my tent was pitched within the rules,
I got up very early, had the other tent pitched without the
rules, went into it, and struck the former. Captain C⸺
wrote to mention it had been observed that the tent had been
pitched within the line of sentries, and to request I would give
orders to my khalasīs to prevent the recurrence of the circumstance.
I therefore determined to change my route; and a note
having come from Mrs. H⸺, saying their party having
quitted the great camp were going to Alligarh, and requesting
me to join them, I accepted the invitation with great pleasure.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Finished a march of fifteen miles before half-past eight
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; halted at Nawabgunge; breakfasted with my friends; a
most kind welcome, a bright fire, and an excellent breakfast,
made me quite happy. The formality of the great camp I had
just quitted formed a strong contrast to the gaiety and cheerfulness
of marching under the flag of the Resident of Gwalior.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—We arrived at Khāsgunge, and encamped in the
Mango Tope just beyond the village. After breakfast, I drove
four miles to see Mr. James Gardner, who had succeeded to his
father’s property, and was living at his house. I found the place
quite deserted; Mr. Gardner was at one of his villages some miles
off, but his wife, Mulka Begam, was at home. I sent word I would
pay my respects to her if she could receive me. In the mean time
I went into the garden, and visited all those spots where I had so
often enjoyed the society of my dear friend Colonel Gardner.
The pavilion in the centre of the garden, in which I had nursed
him when he was so ill, recalled to mind the conversation we
then had, which ended in his taking me to the tomb of his son
just beyond the garden; we sat on that tomb, and the dear old
man said, pointing to the spot, “I wish to be buried there, by
the side of my son; another year will not pass ere I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
placed there; you are very kind in trying to persuade me, my
dear daughter, that I have still many years before me, but I feel
I am going, my constitution is gone; it is well that with old
age we feel all these pains and the ills that accompany it; were
it not so, we should never be willing to quit this world.” Our
conversation lasted some time, afterwards he took my arm, and
we returned slowly to the house. I visited his grave: his son
had raised a tomb on the spot selected by his father; it was not
quite finished. I knelt at the grave of my kind, kind friend,
and wept and prayed in deep affliction. His Begam had only
survived him a few days. She was buried in the same tomb,
with her head to Mecca, towards which place the face of a true
believer is always turned when laid in the grave. The corpse
of a Muhammadan is laid on its back in the grave, with the
head to the north and feet to the south, turning its face towards
the kibla (or Mecca, <i>i.e.</i> west). The Shī’as make their tombs
for men of the same shape as the Sunnīs make those for
females; and for women like those of the Sunnīs for men, but
with a hollow, or basin, in the centre of the upper part.</p>

<p>Mulka Begam received me very kindly; she showed me her
little girl, the youngest, about two years old, whom she said was
reckoned very like me. The child was shy, and clung to
her ayha, frightened at a stranger; I could scarcely catch a
glimpse of her face. The eldest boy was from home with his
father; the second son, William Linnæus, so called after his
grandfather, was at home; he is a very fine, intelligent boy. I
requested leave to bring Mrs. H⸺ to pay her a visit that
evening, and then asking permission to depart, I returned to the
tents. In the evening, our party set off for Khāsgunge: we
walked in the garden, and visited the tomb. Major Sutherland
spoke of Colonel Gardner as a most gallant officer, and recorded
several most dashing actions in which he had distinguished
himself in many parts of the country; gallantry that had not
met the recompense due to it from Government;—the value of a
spirit such as Colonel Gardner’s had not been properly appreciated
by the rulers of the land.</p>

<p>When the evening closed in, the gentlemen went into the outer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
house, and I took Mrs. H⸺ into the zenāna: as dark beauties
always look best by candle-light, I had selected a late hour to
visit the Begam; she was sitting on her gaddī when we went in,
surrounded by her three beautiful children, and was in herself a
picture. The little girl, my likeness, had lost all her shyness,
and was figuring about like a dancing girl; on remarking the
extraordinary change from shyness to such violent spirits,
Mulka said, “She has had some opium, that makes her so
fearless.” We sat an hour with the Begam, and then took
our leave. We found the gentlemen in the outer house,
sitting over a warm fire, and an excellent dinner of native
dishes was ready; having dined, we returned by torch-light to
the tents.</p>

<p>My friends were much gratified with their visit to Khāsgunge;
I had spoken so warmly of the beauty of Mulka Begam, that I
was pleased to find Mrs. H⸺ admired equally both her
person and manners.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Our morning march was thus: Mr. H⸺, Major
Sutherland and myself on horseback; Mrs. H⸺ in a palanquin-carriage,
that rivalled Noah’s ark; it held herself, three children,
three ayhas, two dogs, and packages without number; four good
Arab horses had hard work to pull it six miles over such roads:
the rest of the march was performed in buggies, with a relay of
horses on the road. Major Sutherland, on his beautiful Arab,
used to fly over the country in true Pindaree style; some of his
Arabs I coveted exceedingly. In the evening the gentlemen
took their guns; no game was to be found,—the land was generally
perfectly bare, not a blade of grass,—the game had perished
for want of food. The whole country around Zezaree was very
flat and uninteresting; the only picturesque object we could
find during these evening rambles was an old well; these wells
we used to seek out and peer into as if we belonged to the
Thuggee department, and were searching for dead bodies. Our
life in tents was very agreeable, and I believe the whole party
were sorry the next march would bring us to Alligarh, and
once more into the form and stupidity of life in a house; for
myself, the idea of having any roof over my head but that of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
tent fell like a nightmare on my spirits; and the giving up
hunting for old wells was a complete sacrifice.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Arrived at Alligarh; were kindly welcomed by Mr.
and Mrs. H⸺, and pitched our tents in the Compound; in
the evening we visited the fort, rendered famous for the gallant
style in which it was taken, in Lord Lake’s time, from General
Perron. The fort was strong, and surrounded by a fine ditch;
to have approached it in a regular manner would have taken a
month. A party of the ⸺ regiment had a skirmish with
some of the men belonging to the fort; as these men retreated
over the first bridge the English fought with, and entered the first
gate with them. When within the gate they were exposed
to a heavy fire on every side; just under a large peepul tree,
close to the gate, six of the officers were killed; the rest crossed
the second bridge, and fixed their ladders on the wall; but by
their own ladders the enemy descended upon them. After
dreadful slaughter, the second gate was entered, and the English
took possession of the fort.</p>

<p>General M⸺ was wounded in the assault, and obliged to
retire; it was fortunate for his memory he was an actor in one
scene of gallantry, for his after-conduct gave rise to a song that
is known to every sepahī in the service.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The English lowered the walls of the fort, but left one small
portion standing, to show their great original height. The fort
formerly had but one entrance, which opened on the ditch; the
English built another gate on the opposite side, and another
bridge across the ditch; the place was kept in repair for a short
time, but is now in ruins. Within the fort, on the right, is a
model of the ground plan. I only regret I cannot very well
remember all that was told me at the time in the most animated
manner by Major Sutherland, who, himself a distinguished
officer, was greatly interested in the Fort of Alligarh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Our party drove to the race-stand, to see the horses
that are in training for the races: certainly, Botanist and
Faustus, two very fine Arabs, belonging to Mr. B⸺, are
beautiful creatures. In the evening we visited a house and
garden, formerly the property of General Perron, now in the
possession of Major Derridon, who married his sister.</p>

<p>Major Cureton, of the 16th Lancers, dined with us; we had a
long conversation about the old regiment; he told me the 16th
had sent Mr. Blood a present of a silver shield. How much the
old man will feel and value the honour conferred upon him by
his regiment!</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Visited Mr. B⸺’s stud to see his beautiful Arabs:
in the evening we went to the tomb of the officers who fell at
the taking of the Fort; eight of them are buried there, and a
monument is erected to their memory. Thence we went to a
Masjid, situated on a hill in the town,—a very picturesque object
from a distance. At its side is the ruin of a very old Kos
Minar, which is remarkable. Rain threatened, the clouds were
black and heavy, the thunder rolled, but only a few, a very few
drops descended. Without rain all the crops now above ground
will perish, and the famine will continue.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—With regret I separated this day from the party, to
pursue my route alone to Meerut, they to take the opposite
direction to Muttra, Gwalior, and Agra: Mr. H⸺ and Miss
B⸺ accompanied me the first six miles on the march. How
curious appeared the solitude of my tents away from the happy
party I had quitted! yet I enjoyed the quiet, the silence, and
the being alone once more.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—Encamped at Koorjah; a tufān of wind and sand
all day; no grass to be had or seen, the earth all dried up.
In the Faquir’s Bāghīcha is a picturesque tomb and ruined
mosque.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Encamped at Bulandsher; quitted the good Delhi road
to turn to Meerut; the wind very high, and miserably cold, the
sand flying like dust, covering every thing in the tent, and
filling my eyes. The servants annoyed me by disobeying orders;
the food was bad,—the Arab’s saddle wrung his back,—every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
thing went wrong. What a distance I have marched! how
generally barren, flat, and uninteresting the country has been!
I saw a very fine banyan tree a day or two ago, but the general
face of the country is a sandy plain, interspersed with a few
green fields near the wells, and topes of mango trees: in one of
these topes my tent is pitched to-day. My beautiful dog Nero
is dead. What folly in this climate to be fond of any thing!—it
is sure to come to an untimely end.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 3rd.</i>—Encamped at Kerkowdah; at this spot my relative,
Capt. E. S⸺, met me, to conduct me to his house at
Meerut. How changed we were! our first impulse was to laugh
at each other; when last we met we were happy young creatures,
playing at games of every sort on the lawn at Somerford Booths.
Our voices, the expression of our countenances, were, perhaps,
the same; in other respects the alteration was so great, how
could we help laughing at each other?</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Arrived at Meerut, pitched my tents in the Compound,
<i>i.e.</i> the grounds around the house.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—The Governor-General and the Camp arrived.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—Attended a ball given by the officers of the artillery to
the Governor-General; Lord Auckland and the Misses Eden
were gracious, and had I not been suffering from illness, I should
have enjoyed the party.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Drove to the Sūraj Kūnd, or Spring of the Sun, a remarkably
large tank; a little further on are a great number of
satī mounds of peculiar construction. In the evening attended
a ball, given by the station to the Governor-General and his
party.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—Dined with General and Mrs. R⸺ to meet the
Governor-General and his party; the dinner was given in one
great tent, which held eighty guests at table. In the evening
the party went to a ball given by the Buffs to the Governor-General;
the room was gay and well-lighted, ornamented with
rays of steel, formed of bayonets and ramrods; a sort of throne
was decorated with the colours of the regiment for the Governor-General.
The dancing was carried on with spirit; the finale an
excellent supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>Mr. W⸺ invited me to Lahore, to witness the meeting of
the Governor-General and Runjeet Singh. I promised to accept
the invitation, if in that part of the world in November, but I
fear I shall be far distant. Captain O⸺ sent me three Italian
greyhound pups; they dart about in the most amusing manner.
I hope the little delicate creatures will live. Wishing to view
the ruins of Delhi, I sent off my tents one march to await me.
In the evening I went to the theatre, to see the performance of
the privates of the artillery. The men built their own theatre,
painted their own scenes, and are themselves the performers.
The scenery is excellent, the house crowded; the men acted
remarkably well; and the ladies, strapping artillery men, six feet
high, were the cause of much laughter. A letter from Allahabad
informed me, “the 12th of January was one of the great
bathing days, the river and its banks were covered with the
pilgrims; for days and days we saw them passing in one almost
continued line, very few rich people amongst them, principally
the lower orders. There is no tax now levied by the Government,
but an officer is sent down with a guard as usual. There
was a storm in the morning, and the rain had been pouring ever
since. The poor creatures now on their way in thousands for
to-morrow’s bathing will suffer dreadfully, and all their tamāshā
be spoiled.”</p>

<p>1838, <i>Feb.</i>—With the Neapolitan saying, “Vedi Napoli, e poi
mori,” I beg leave to differ entirely, and would rather offer <i>this</i>
advice,—“See the Tājmahal, and then—see the Ruins of Delhi.”
How much there is to delight the eye in this bright, this beautiful
world! Roaming about with a good tent and a good Arab, one
might be happy for ever in India: a man might possibly enjoy
this sort of life more than a woman; he has his dog, his gun,
and his beaters, with an open country to shoot over, and is not
annoyed with—“I’ll thank you for your name, Sir.” I have a
pencil instead of a gun, and believe it affords me satisfaction
equal, if not greater than the sportsman derives from his
Manton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>On my return from the theatre I sought my charpāī, and
slept—Oh, how soundly!—was dressed, and on my horse by
6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, having enjoyed four hours and a half of perfect rest.
“Sleep is the repose of the soul<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.” I awoke from my slumber
perfectly refreshed, and my little soul was soon cantering away
on the back of an Arab, enjoying the pure, cool, morning breeze.
Oh! the pleasure of vagabondizing over India!</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—We rode part of the distance, and drove the remainder
of the march, sixteen miles; found the tents ready, and the
khidmatgārs on the look out. Took a breakfast such as hungry
people eat, and then retired to our respective tents. The fatigue
was too much; the novel dropped from my hand, and my sleepy
little soul sank to repose for some hours.</p>

<p>When the sun was nearly down, we roamed over the fields
with the gentlemen and their guns, but found no game. Thus
passed the day of the first march on the road to Delhi at
Begamabad.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Arrived early at Furrudnagar, another long distance;
a high wind, clouds of dust, and a disagreeable day. During
the night the servants were robbed of all their brass lotas and
cooking utensils. A thief crept up to my camels, that were
picketed just in front of the tent, selected the finest, cut the
rope and strings from his neck; then, having fastened a very
long thin rope to the animal, away crept the thief. Having got
to the end of the line, the thief gave the string a pull, and continued
doing so until he rendered the camel uneasy; the animal
got up,—another pull—he turned his head, another—and he
quietly followed the twitching of the cord that the thief held;
who succeeded in separating him from the other camels, and got
him some twenty yards from the tent; just at this moment the
sentry observed the camel quietly departing, he gave the alarm,
the thief fled, and the animal was brought back to the camp;—a
few yards more the thief would have been on his back, and we
should have lost the camel.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Marched into Delhi: the first sight of the city from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
the sands of the Jumna is very imposing; the fort, the palace,
the mosques and minarets, all crowded together on the bank of
the river, is a beautiful sight. “In the year of the Hijerah,

city and palace of Shāhjahānabad, which he made his capital
during the remainder of his reign. The new city of Shāhjahānabad
lies on the western bank of the Jumna, in latitude 28° 36′
North. The city is about seven miles in circumference, and is
surrounded on three sides by a wall of brick and stone; a
parapet runs along the whole, but there are no cannon planted
on the ramparts. The city has seven gates: viz., <i>Lahore</i> gate,
<i>Delhi</i> gate, <i>Ajimere</i> gate, <i>Turkoman</i> gate, <i>Moor</i> gate, <i>Cabul</i> gate,
<i>Cashmere</i> gate; all of which are built of freestone, and have
handsome arched entrances of stone, where the guards of the
city kept watch.”</p>

<p>We entered the town by the Delhi gate: during the rains,
when the river flows up to and by the walls of the city, the view
from a boat must be beautiful; at present the river is shallow,
with great sandbanks in the centre. We crossed a bridge of
boats, and encamped in front of the church.</p>

<p>The church was built by Colonel Skinner, planned by Colonel
S⸺; I do not like the design: it was put into execution by
Captain D⸺. The dome appears too heavy for the body of
the church, and in the inside it is obliged to be supported by
iron bars,—a most unsightly affair. A man should visit the
ruins of Gaur, and there learn how to build a dome, ere he
attempt it. Colonel Skinner is a Christian; the ladies of his
family are Musalmanīs, and for them he has built a mosque opposite
the church. In the churchyard is the tomb of Mr. William
Frazer, who was murdered by the Nawab Shumsheodin: Colonel
Skinner has erected a monument to the memory of his friend;
it is of white marble, in compartments, which are inlaid with
green stones, representing the weeping willow; the whole was
executed at Jeypore, and cost, it is said, 10,000 rupees. On the
top is a vase, and, in a compartment in front of the church is a
Persian inscription. Below are these lines, and in front of
the lines are two lions reposing: to none but an Irishman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
would it be clear that the <i>us</i> in the epitaph proceeds from the
lions:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In the evening the brother of the Bāiza Bā’ī, Hindū Rāo,
sent me an elephant, and Colonel Skinner sent another; on
these we mounted, and went through all the principal streets of
the city. Dehlī or Dillī, the metropolis of Hindūstān, is generally
called by Musalmāns Shāhjahān-ābād, and, by Europeans,
Delhi. The Chāndnī chauk, a very broad and handsome street,
is celebrated; it has a canal that runs through and down the
centre of it; but such is the demand for water, that not a drop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
now reaches Delhi, it being drawn off for the irrigation of the
country, ere it arrive at the city. This fine stream is called
<i>Nahr-i-Bihísht</i>, or “Canal of Paradise.” “In the reign of
Shāhjahān, Ali Merdan Khan, a nobleman, dug, at his own
expense, a canal, from the vicinity of the city of Panniput, near
the head of the Doo-ab, to the suburbs of Delhi;—a tract of
ninety miles in extent. This noble canal is called by the natives
the ‘Canal of Paradise,’ and runs from north to south, in
general about ten miles distant from the Jumna, until it joins
that river nine miles below the city of New Delhi: it yielded
formerly fourteen lākh of rupees per annum. At present it
is out of repair, and in many places almost destroyed.”</p>

<p>As we went round the Jáma Masjid, a fine mosque, I thought
of the words of the Prophet,—“Masjids are the gardens of
Paradise, and the praises of God the fruit thereof.” On the
high flight of steps leading to the mosque were hundreds of
people in gay dresses, bargaining for cloth, sweetmeats, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Delhi appear to delight in dresses of the
gayest colours, and picturesque effect is added to every scene by
their graceful attire. Native gentlemen of rank, attended by
large <i>sawārīs</i> (retinues) on horseback, on elephants, or on
camels, are met at every turn, rendering the scene very
amusing and animated. Nevertheless, in spite of all this
apparent splendour, a proverb is used to express the vanity
and indigence prevalent in that city:—“Dillī ke dilwālī munh
chiknā pet khālī;” “The inhabitants of Dihlī appear to be opulent,
when, in fact, they are starving.” A little beyond the
Jáma Masjid is the wall of the palace,—a most magnificent
wall; I was delighted with it and its gateways. Shortly afterwards
we turned our elephants towards the tents, and returned,
considerably fatigued, to dinner.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—This morning we had decided on visiting the tomb of
Humaioon, but, on mounting our horses, hearing firing at a
distance, we rode off to see what amusement was going forward,
leaving the visit to the tomb for another day. It was lucky we
did so, I would not on any account have missed the scene. We
galloped away, to save time, and found Lord Auckland and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
party at a review; after looking at the review a short time,
Captain S⸺, himself an engineer, took me to see a very
interesting work: the sappers and miners had erected a mud-fort;
trenches were regularly formed in front of the fort, to
cover the attacking party, and mines were formed underground
to a considerable distance. We walked through the long
galleries, which were all lighted up, and Captain S⸺ explained
the whole to me. On our return, Lord Auckland came up,
examined the fort, and walked through the miners’ galleries.
The attack commenced, the great guns blazed away at the
bastion, which was blown up in good style by the miners; the
soldiers mounted the breach and took the fort, whilst, on the
right, it was scaled by another party. This mimic war was very
animated; I like playing at soldiers, and it gave me an excellent
idea of an attack, without the horror of the reality: another
mine was sprung, and the warfare ended. The sun was high
and very hot,—we rode home as fast as our horses could carry
us,—only stopping on the top of a rocky hill near the late
Mr. Frazer’s house, to admire the view of Delhi, which lay below
a mass of minarets and domes, interspersed with fine trees.
Near this spot Mr. Frazer was shot. The house was bought by
Hindū Rāo for 20,000 rupees. Out of this rocky hill a sort of
red gravel is dug, which forms the most beautiful roads.</p>

<p>After breakfast we struck our tents, and came to stay with a
friend, who has a fine house in beautiful grounds, with a
garden filled to profusion with the gayest flowers, situated just
beyond the Cashmere gate of the city. Colonel Edward Smith,
of the engineers, deserves great credit for the style and good
taste he has displayed in the architecture of this gate of Delhi,
and for several other buildings which were pointed out to me as
of his design in other parts of the city. We found the tents
very hot within the walls, with flies innumerable, like the plague
of Egypt; at least, they must be quite as bad during the hot
season. In the evening we went to a ball, given by Mr. Metcalfe
to the Governor-General and his party.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—The ball gave me a headache, and I was suffering a
good deal of pain, when a native lady came to see me, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
part of the Nawāb Shah Zamānee Begam, the Emperor’s
unmarried sister, from whom she brought a complimentary
message, and a request that I would call upon her at the palace.
The lady, finding me in pain, most kindly shampooed and mulled
my forehead so delightfully, that my headache was charmed
away;—shampooing is the great luxury of the East.</p>

<h3>MAUSOLEUM OF HUMAIOON.</h3>

<p>In the evening we drove through the ruins of old Delhi to
the tomb of the Emperor Humaioon. The drive is most interesting;
you cannot turn your eye in any direction but you are
surrounded by ruins of the most picturesque beauty. The tomb
of Humaioon is a fine massive building, well worth visiting: it
is kept in good repair. There are several monuments within
the chambers of the mausoleum that are of carved white marble.
The tomb of the Emperor is very plain, and without any inscription.
On the terrace is a very elegant white marble monument,
richly carved, of peculiar construction, over the remains of a
Begam. The different and extensive views from the terrace over
the ruins of old Delhi are very beautiful.</p>

<p>Captain William Franklin gives the following description of
this mausoleum:—</p>

<p>“The tomb of Humaioon, the son of Baber, the second of
the imperial house of Timur, was erected by his son Akbar, on
the western bank of the Jumna, in the old city of Delhi.</p>

<p>“The terrace, which is of red stone, is two thousand feet in
circumference. The mausoleum, which is also of red stone,
rises from this terrace. It is of circular form, surmounted by a
stupendous dome of white marble. Conspicuous from its
dimensions, this dome is seen from a great distance. Four
minarets of red and white marble support the extremities of the
building. These are crowned with octagonal pavilions of red
stone, having marble cupolas. I judge the height to be about
one hundred and twenty feet. A winding staircase of red stone
leads to a terrace, which encircles the exterior of the dome:
hence you have a noble prospect, both of old and new Delhi.</p>

<p>“The principal room below is paved with large slabs of white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
marble. It contains the tomb of Humaioon, of the common
size, but elegantly decorated with chisel work. It bears no
inscription. Adjoining to this room are other apartments, in
which are interred several princesses of the house of Timur.</p>

<p>“Upon the terrace before-mentioned are the graves of five
princes of the royal family; viz., Darah Shekoah, who was put
to death by the order of his brother Aurunzebe; 2nd, Mooizadeen,
or Jahandar; 3rdly, Shah Furrukseir, put to death by the
Seyuds; 4thly, Beedar Bukht; and 5thly, Azim Shah, son of
Aurunzebe. Near them is the grave of the late emperor, the
second Aulumgeer.</p>

<p>“About two hundred yards from this mausoleum, is that of
the famous Khan Khanan, prime minister of Jehangeer, and
son of the renowned Byram Khan, remarkable for contributing
in so great a degree, during the successive reigns of Humaioon,
Akbar, and Jehangeer, to establish the house of Timur on the
throne of Hindostan. The tomb resembles, both in size and
shape, that of the Nawāb Suftar Jung.”</p>

<p>On our return, we visited the old Fort of Delhi. The
guide pointed out to us a building, which he called a khwāb
khāna, or sleeping apartment; from this building Humaioon fell
by accident, and was killed.</p>

<p>The mosque in the Fort attracted our admiration; it is a
beautiful building. Passing out at the other gate brought us
opposite to the Lall Durwaza, the carriage was in waiting, and
I returned home.</p>

<h3>KOTĪLA OF FEROZE SHĀH.</h3>

<p><i>Feb. 21st.</i>—We mounted our horses and rode to a ruin,
beyond the Delhi Gate, called the Kotīla of Feroze Shāh. This
is an old Fort completely in ruins. In the centre some arches
still remain, on the top of which is a platform, on which
is erected a <i>lāt</i>, a pillar of a single stone of great height,
which is said to be of granite; a number of inscriptions are on
the pillar. It measures at the base upwards of twelve feet
in circumference. The top is broken, apparently shivered by
lightning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>The following extracts, from Captain William Franklin’s
Memoirs of Mr. George Thomas, and his Visit to Delhi in 1793,
are interesting:—</p>

<p>“A mile to the southward of the city are the remains of the
fort, palace, and mosque of the Patan emperor, the first Feroze.
These ruins embrace a considerable extent. The walls of the
fort are of immense thickness, and the prodigious quantity of
granite, with other stones, spread in heaps over the whole of the
interior of the inclosure, denote it to have been a grand and
splendid edifice. This fort was built Anno Hijirah 755, and
was destroyed by the Mogul conqueror Timoor, in his invasion
of Hindostan. Toward the centre of the place, is a building,
of an ancient style, flanked with round pillars, and crowned
with turrets of three stories. At the top of this building, on an
ample terrace of stone, about forty feet in height, is a column
of brown granite. On this column is an inscription, in the
ancient character before-mentioned, as discernible on the pillar
in the Fort of Allahabad, and composed of the same materials.
This pillar is called by the natives Feroze Cotelah, the staff of
Feroze; and from the construction of the building on which it is
placed, I should conjecture it has been a monument of Hindoo
grandeur prior to the irruptions of the Musulmans. Adjoining
to the Cotelah is a very large building, differing in the style
of its architecture from those mosques built subsequent to the
establishment of the Moguls. This mosque is square, has four
extensive aisles, or cloisters, the roofs of which are stone, and
supported by two hundred and fifty columns of stone, about
sixteen feet high. The length of the cloisters gives a grand
appearance to the building. An octangular dome of stone and
brickwork, about twenty-five feet high, rises from the centre of
the mosque. In the western cloister, is a <i>kibla</i>, or niche in the
wall, in the direction of Mecca. Of this mosque, the Emperor
Timoor took a model, and carrying it with him on his return to
Samarcand, his capital, accompanied at the same time by artificers
and workmen of every description, he, shortly after his
arrival, built a magnificent temple.</p>

<p>“In the northern aisle of this mosque, at the upper end, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
small window, from which was thrown the body of the late
Emperor Allumgeer, who had been assassinated at the instigation
of his Vizier, Gaziodeen Khan. The assassins were two Mahomedan
devotees, whom he had invited under the pretence of
their working miracles. The body of this unfortunate prince,
unburied, for two days lay on the sands of the Jumna. At last
it was taken up by the permission of Gaziodeen, and interred
in the sepulchre of Humaioon. To me it appears that the style
of building in this mosque refers to a period in the architecture
of the Hindoos prior to the Mogul conquests. The mosque at
Paniput, erected by the Emperor Baber, may be looked upon as
the model of all the succeeding Mogul buildings.”</p>

<p>The Akbārābādee Masjid, which we next visited, is a large
mosque, not very remarkable; perhaps this is the Masjid of the
Akbārābādee Begam, whose tomb is near the Tāj at Agra.</p>

<p>Thence we went to the Zeenut-al-Masjid, on the side of the
Jumna, erected by a daughter of Aurangzeb, by name Zeenut-al-Nissa;
it is a very beautiful mosque, the minarets remarkably
elegant, and two of the pillars in front of the entrance,
beautifully carved, are of elegant form. “It is of red stone,
with inlayings of marble, and has a spacious terrace in front,
with a capacious reservoir, faced with marble. The princess
who built it, having declined entering into the married state,
laid out a large sum of money in the above mosque; and on its
completion, she built a sepulchre of white marble, surrounded
by a wall of the same, in the west corner of the terrace. Here
she was buried, in the year of the Hijerah 1122, corresponding
to the year of Christ, 1710.”</p>

<p>We called on Colonel Skinner, and saw his sister, an old lady
very like her brother, with a dark complexion and white hair.
The Chandnī Chauk is a fine street, and its bazār the best in the
city; we rode through it about 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; it was filled with crowds
of gaily-dressed natives.</p>

<h3>MASJID OF ROSHAN-OOL-DOWLA.</h3>

<p>We observed with great interest the gilded domes of the
mosque of Roshan-ool-Dowla, at one end of the Chandnī<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
Chauk; it is of the common size, built of red stone, and surmounted
by three domes. The King of Persia took Delhi,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1739. Nadir Shah, on hearing of a tumult that broke out
in the great market-place, in which two thousand Persians were
slain, marched out at night with his men as far as this Masjid;
here he thought it prudent to halt until daylight. When daylight
began to appear, a person from a neighbouring terrace
fired upon the king, and killed an officer by his side. Nadir
Shah was so much enraged, that although the tumult had by
this time totally subsided, he sent out his soldiers, and ordered
a general massacre of the inhabitants. This order was executed
with so much rigour, that before 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, above one hundred
thousand, without distinction of age, sex, or condition, lay dead
in their blood, although not above one-third part of the city
was visited by the sword. Nadir Shah sat during this dreadful
scene in the Masjid of Roshan-ool-Dowla; none but slaves
dared approach him. At length the unfortunate Emperor of
Delhi, attended by a number of his chief omrah, ventured before
him with downcast eyes. The omrah who preceded the king,
bowed their foreheads to the ground. Nadir Shah sternly asked
them what they wanted? They cried out with one voice, “Spare
the city.” Muhammad said not a word, but the tears flowed
fast from his eyes. The tyrant, for once touched with pity,
sheathed his sword, and said, “For the sake of the prince
Muhammad I forgive.” The massacre was instantly stopped.</p>

<p>Since that dreadful carnage, this quarter of Delhi has been
but very thinly inhabited.</p>

<p>An auction of the presents that had been made to the Government
having been advertised to take place at a <i>Europe shop</i> in
Delhi, I went to the place, and desired them to purchase several
articles for me, among others a single sheet of paper that
measured forty feet in length by nineteen feet and a half in
breadth. It is made, they tell me, from the fibres of the leaf,
or the bark of a tree, and is brought from Almorah and other
parts of the hills. Some of the sheets are very large and rather
coarse, others are smaller and very fine; insects do not attack
shawls that are wrapped in this sort of paper. An Amadou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
made from the same fibre is also brought from Almorah. I
may here mention that many years afterwards I saw, at the
Asiatic Society in London, a similar piece of paper ticketed,
“A single sheet of paper measuring sixty feet by twenty-five,
made in Kumaon, from the inner fibres of the <i>Set Burrooah</i>, or
Daphne-Cannabind-tree; presented to the Asiatic Society by
G. W. Traill, Esq., 1839.” Datisca cannabina, Hemp-like Datisca,
Loudon.</p>

<p>I also saw there an enormous pod of the mimosa scandens,
a wild creeper; the seed is called <i>gela</i>, and is used by natives
chiefly for washing the hair. The dhobīs cut a hole in the
centre of this seed, and by rubbing it up and down on the
muslin sleeves of native dresses, produce a sort of <i>goufré</i>, that is
admired and worn by opulent men. Speaking of washermen,
it appears to me a most extraordinary thing that the English
have never adopted the Asiatic method of <i>steaming</i> the clothes
in lieu of boiling them. The process of washing by steam is
very simple, gives but little trouble, and produces the most
delicate whiteness. The washermen place the clothes in the
evening over the most simple steam apparatus in the world,
leave them all night to steam, by the next morning they are
clean and fit to be removed; when all that is necessary is to
rinse them in the river, dry, and iron them. What a saving of
expense, time, and trouble it would be if this method were to
be adopted in the public washing-houses in England!</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Drove to Sir David Auchterlony’s house; there was
but little to see there. Attended a ball given by the station to
the Governor-General; remained an hour, and returned early to
be ready for our expedition the next morning.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Mounted our horses at daybreak, and started for the
Kutab. Passed the observatory without visiting it; stopped to
view the tomb of Munsoor Ali Khan Sufter Jung, Wuzeer of
the Emperor Ahmud Shah, who died in 1753—1167; it is a
handsome edifice.</p>

<h3>THE KUTAB MINĀR.</h3>

<p>I had seen many drawings of this famous minār, and imagined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
I had a perfect idea of what I was to behold. The reality far
exceeded my expectations, on account of its grandeur, its enormous
height, and the beauty of the building. Around the
Kutab are the ruins of the most magnificent arches I should
think in the world. Only one of these arches is entire, its
proportions are very fine; a few years,—another year, perhaps,—and
this beautiful arch will give way; the upper part is tottering
to its fall even now. The Kutab Minār is perhaps so called
from <i>Kutb</i> the polar star, as being particularly distinguished and
attractive of general attention; or after the conqueror of Delhi,
Kutab-ud-din-Ibek, the polar star of religion; or after the
famous saint, Kutb-ud-din, whose tomb lies about half a mile
<span class="allsmcap">S.W.</span> of the column.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Inscriptions on the Kutab Minār, transcribed and translated
by Walter Ewer, Esq.</p>

<p>“Kutub-ud-din-Ibek, on whom be the mercy of God, constructed
this mosque.”</p>

<p>“In the name of the most merciful God.—The Lord has
invited to Paradise, and brings into the way of righteousness,
him who wills it.—In the year 592 this building was commenced
by the high command of Moez-ud-dunyā-ul-din Mahomad Beni
Jam-Nasir Amir Mominin.”</p>

<p>“The Sultan Shems-ul-Hak-wa-ud-din Altamsh erected this
building.”</p>

<p>“In the year 907 this minār, having been injured by lightning,
by the aid of, and favour of God, Firoz-mund Yamani
restored whatever was needed by the building. May the Lord
preserve this lofty edifice from future mischance!”</p>

<p>“The erection of this building was commanded in the
glorious time of the great Sultan, and mighty King of kings
and Master of mankind, the Lord of the monarchs of Turkistan,
Arabia, and Persia; the Sun of the world and religion, of the
faith and the faithful; the Lord of safety and protection; the
Heir of the kingdom of Suliman Abul Muzeffer Altamsh Nasir
Amin-ul-Mominin.”</p>

<p>“The prophet, on whom be the mercy and peace of God, has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
declared, ‘Whosoever erects a temple to the true God on earth,
shall receive six such dwellings in Paradise.’—The Minār, the
dwelling of the king of kings, Shems-ul-dunyā-wa-ud-din, now
in peace and pardon,—(be his tomb protected, and his place
assigned in Heaven!)—was injured by lightning in the reign
of the exalted monarch, Secunder, the son of Behlol—(may
his power and empire last for ever, and his reign be glorious!):
and therefore his slave, Futteh Khan, the son of Musnud Ali,
the liberal of liberals, and the meritorious servant of the king,
repaired it according to command, the 13th of Rubi-ul-Akber,
in the year 909.”</p>

<p class="right"><i>March 30th, 1825.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Franklin’s account of this pillar is as follows:—“The Coottub
Minar is situated near, and derives its name from, the tomb
of Khaja Cuttubadeen. His disciple, Shemsadeen, of the
family of Ghazi, erected this column, anno Hijira, 770. The
column has a most stupendous appearance: conceive a shaft
of sixty feet diameter, composed partly of red stone, partly
of white marble, rising to the height of two hundred and fifty
feet.</p>

<p>“Ascending this pillar, relief is afforded by four projecting
galleries of red stone; tapering towards the summit, it was
crowned with an octagonal pavilion, which perhaps would have
contained at least a dozen persons. Each of the galleries are
most richly, though differently, ornamented: the column is
relieved and rendered strikingly bold by convex and angular
projections.</p>

<p>“Within this grand tower is a circular staircase of three
hundred and eighty steps of red stone; there are, at intervals,
landing-places, which communicate with the windows; from the
octagon on the summit the view is strikingly grand. Inscriptions
in several parts twelve inches in breadth, embrace the column;
these contain verses from the khoran, in the Arabic character.
The galleries are supported by sculptured ornaments, of which
the richness is greatly heightened by a profusion of frieze-work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>On the night of the 31st of August, 1803, the minār was
shattered from the foundation by an earthquake; the injury
occasioned by it has been lately repaired by Colonel Edward
Smith, of the engineers, who conducted the work with great
judgment, having to remove and refix some of the large stones
at the base of the tower. His judgment and taste failed when
repairing the top of the edifice; even from a distance the sort
of pavilion which he erected on the top appears heavy, and
unfitted to the proportions of the rest of the minār, which is
fine by degrees, and beautifully less. Not content with this, he
placed an umbrella of Chinese form on the top of the pavilion;
it was not destined to remain,—the lightning struck it off, as if
indignant at the profanation. The minār is covered with Arabic
inscriptions and the most elaborate workmanship.</p>

<p>The colonnades around the Kutab are very remarkable;
some of them are of the same style of architecture as the old
Hindū ruin at Kanauj, of which I have given a sketch; one
large long stone placed upright upon another of the same
description, without any mortar. Some of the colonnades are
almost perfectly plain, others richly sculptured; they appear to
be very ancient.</p>

<h3>KUTAB KÍ LĀT.</h3>

<p>West of the Kutab, about fifty yards, and in the middle of
the colonnaded court in front of the exquisite arch I mentioned
before, stands an iron column about twenty feet high, called
“<i>Kutab kí Lāt</i>,” or “Kutab’s Staff.” It is covered with
inscriptions, some of which are said to be in an unknown
character, and are nearly effaced by time. The more recent are
in Persian and Hindī characters. It is said that this iron column
was raised by the grandfather of Raja Pittourah, on the representation
of the Brahmans, who assured him that the sceptre
would never depart from his posterity as long as this pillar
stood. Raja Pittourah, however, was killed in the eighth battle
fought near Delhi by Kutab-u-dīn-Abek, who, to show his
contempt for the prophecy of the Brahmans, and to evince its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
failure, allowed the column to remain. The pillar is dented
near the top by a cannon-shot fired at it by Gholam Kadir.</p>

<p>Near the Kutab is the foundation of another minār, which
was commenced on a larger scale, but was never finished.</p>

<p>Extracts from Colonel John Luard’s “Views in India”—“The
Cutteb Minar Dhelie.”⸺“This wonderful pillar derives its
name from Cutteb-ud-din (the pole-star of religion) who having
come from Turkistan as a slave, was purchased by the Emperor
Mahomed Ghori—rose in his favour,—became a general,—and
ultimately succeeded to the throne,—and was the first of the
Patan, or Afghan sovereigns. In the year 589 Hegira, 1193 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
he took the fort of Merut, and the city of Dhelie, from the
family of Candy Rai, and established the seat of his government
there, and obliged all the districts around to acknowledge the
Mussalman faith. To commemorate this and other successes
over the infidels, this pillar was commenced about the year
1195 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> The circumference at the base is 143 feet;—height
of the first balcony, 90 feet—the second, 140—the third, 180—the
fourth, 203.—Total height in 1826 was 243 feet. The
original sketch was made in 1823.”</p>

<p>“Shumse-ud-din-Altumsh married a daughter of Cuttub-ud-din-Ibek.
Like his father-in-law, he was formerly a slave, and
was purchased for 50,000 pieces of silver. He became a great
general, and succeeded to the imperial throne of Dhelie in 607
Hegira, 1210 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> He was an able, enterprising, and good
prince—reigned twenty-six years,—died in 1235 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and is
buried in this elaborately ornamented building, placed about
200 yards from the Cutteb Minar, which he assisted in constructing.
His tomb is built of white marble and red granite.”</p>

<p>Having roamed around the tower and colonnades the whole
morning, we retired to our tents to dine during the heat of the
day.</p>

</div>

<p>1838, <i>Feb. 22nd.</i>—In the cool of the evening we mounted our
horses, and rode to Ancient Delhi, or Indrapesta, now called
Marowlie, the capital of the former Rajas. At this place, many
houses were pointed out to us as having belonged to the mighty
dead; but my attention was arrested by a bā’olī, an immense
well. From the top of the well to the surface of the water the
depth is sixty feet, and the depth of water below forty feet;
just above the surface of the water the side of the well opens on
a flight of stone steps, which lead to the upper regions. I
peered over the well to see the water, and shuddered as I looked
into the dark cold depth below; at that instant a man jumped
from the top into the well, sank a great depth, rose again, and,
swimming to the opening, came up the steps like a drenched
rat; three more immediately followed his example, and then
gaily claimed a “<i>bakshish</i>,” or reward, begging a rupee, which
was given: we did not stay to see the sport repeated, at
which the jumpers appeared disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>Quitting the bā’olī, we visited the tombs of the three last
emperors of Delhi,—Bahādur Shah, Shah’ālam, and Akbar
Shah. The latter had been placed there within a few weeks;
the tomb of Shah’ālam is of white marble, and about
eighteen inches distant from that of the Emperor Bahādur
Shah, over whose tomb flourishes a white jasmine. How are the
mighty fallen! I had visited the tomb of Humaioon, and the
still grander monument of Akbar at Secundra; had admired the
magnificent building, its park and portal. The last Akbar
reposes side by side with the two former emperors. Three
marble tombs, prettily sculptured, in a small open court, the
walls of which are of white marble, is all that adorns the burial-place
of the descendants of Tamurlane!</p>

<p>The building that most interested me was the Royal Zenāna
Ghār. At certain times of the year the Emperor of Delhi used
to retire to this spot with all his ladies; the place is prettily
situated amidst rocks and trees: there, seated at ease on his
cushions of state, his amusement was to watch the sports of the
ladies of the zenāna, as they jumped from the roof of a verandah
into the water below, and then came up to jump in again. On
the other side is another tank, with a sloping bank of masonry;
on this slope the ladies used to sit, and slide down into the tank.
In the water, amidst the trees, the graceful drapery of the
Musulmanī and Hindū ladies clinging to their well-formed
persons must have had a beautiful effect. During these sports
guards were stationed around, to prevent the intrusion of any
profane eye on the sacredness of the zenāna.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we revisited the minār: the night was remarkably
fine, no moon, but a dark blue, clear star-light. The minār is fine
by day, its magnitude surprising; but, by night, a feeling of awe
is inspired by its unearthly appearance. If you ask a native,
“Who built the Kutab?” his answer will generally be,—“God
built it;—who else could have built it?” And such is the feeling
as you stand at the base, looking up to the top of the column of
the polar star, which appears to tower into the skies: I could not
withdraw my eyes from it; the ornaments, beautiful as they are
by day, at night, shadowed as they were into the mass of building,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
only added to its grandeur. We roamed through the colonnades,
in the court of the beautiful arches, and returned most unwillingly
to our tents.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Quitted the Kutab without revisiting Tuglukabad, our
time not admitting of it; and I greatly regretted not having the
power of visiting the tombs that surrounded us on every side
the ruins of Ancient Delhi. The extent of these ruins is supposed
not to be less than a circumference of twenty miles,
reckoning from the gardens of Shalimar, on the north-west, to
the Kutab Minār, on the south-east, and proceeding thence
along the centre of the old city, by way of the mausoleum of
Nizam-al-Deen, the tomb of Humaioon, which adjoins, and the
old fort of Delhi, on the Jumna, to the Ajmeer gate of Shāhjahānabad.
The environs to the north and west are crowded
with the remains of the spacious gardens and country houses of
the nobility, which in former times were abundantly supplied with
water, by means of the noble canal dug by Ali Merdan Khan.</p>

<p>Franklin remarks,—“Ancient Delhi is said by historians to
have been erected by Rajah Delu, who reigned in Hindūstan
prior to the invasion of Alexander the Great: others affirm it
to have been built by Rajah Pettouvar, who flourished at a
much later period. It is called in Sanscrit <i>Indraput</i>, or the
Abode of <i>Indra</i>, one of the Hindū deities, and is thus distinguished
in the royal diplomas of the Chancery office.”</p>

<h3>THE OBSERVATORY.</h3>

<p>On our road home, about a mile and a half from the present city
of Delhi, we stopped to visit the Observatory, <i>Jantr-Mantr</i>, a
building well worthy the inspection of the traveller. The name
of Jayasinha, the Rajah of Ambhere, or Jayanagar, and his astronomical
labours, are not unknown in Europe; but yet the
extent of his exertions in the cause of science is little known;
his just claims to superior genius and zeal demand some enumeration
of the labours of one whose name is conspicuous in the
annals of Hindūstan. Jey-sing or Jayasinha succeeded to the
inheritance of the ancient Rajahs of Ambhere in the year of
Vicramadittya 1750, corresponding to 1693 of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
æra. His mind had been early stored with the knowledge
contained in the Hindū writings, but he appears to have peculiarly
attached himself to the mathematical sciences, and his
reputation for skill in them stood so high, that he was chosen
by the Emperor Mahommed Shah to reform the calendar,
which, from the inaccuracy of the existing tables, had ceased to
correspond with the actual appearance of the heavens. Jayasinha
undertook the task, and constructed a new set of tables;
which, in honour of the reigning prince, he named Zeej
Mahommedshahy. By these, almanacks are constructed at
Delhi, and all astronomical computations made at the present
time.</p>

<p>The five observatories, which were built and finished by Jayasinha,
still exist in a state more or less perfect; they were
erected at Jeypoor, Matra, Benares, Oujein, and Delhi.</p>

<p>The next observatory, in point of size and preservation, is
that at Oujein; it is situated at the southern extremity of the
city, in the quarter called <i>Jeysingpoorah</i>, and where are still the
remains of a palace of Jayasinha, who was subahdar of Malwa
in the time of Mahommed Shah. The observatory at Oujein
has since been converted into an arsenal and foundry of
cannon.</p>

<p>At Matra, the remains of the observatory are in the fort
which was built by Jayasinha on the banks of the Jumna.</p>

<p>The observatory at Delhi is situated without the wall of the
city, at the distance of one mile and a quarter. It consists of
several detached buildings:—</p>

<p>1. A large equatorial dial: its form is pretty entire, but the
edges of the gnomon, and those of the circle on which the
degrees were marked, are broken in several places. This is the
instrument called by Jayasinha <i>semrat-yunter</i> (the prince of
dials). It is built of stone, but the edges of the gnomon, and
of the arches where the gradation was, were of white marble;
a few small portions of which only remain.</p>

<p>2. At a little distance from this instrument, towards the
north-west, is another equatorial dial; more entire, but smaller
and of a different construction. In the middle stands a gnomon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
which, as usual in these buildings, contains a staircase up to the
top. On each side of this gnomon are two concentric semicircles,
having for their diameters the two edges of the gnomon;
it is evident that they represent meridians. On each side of
this post is another gnomon, equal in size to the former; and to
the eastward and westward of them are the arches on which the
hours are marked.</p>

<p>3. The north wall of this building connects the three
gnomons at their highest end; and on this wall is
described a graduated semicircle, for taking the altitudes of
bodies that lie due east, or due west, from the eye of the
observer.</p>

<p>4. To the westward of this building, and close to it, is a
wall, in the plane of the meridian, on which is described a
double quadrant, having for the centres the two upper corners
of the wall, for observing the altitudes of bodies passing the
meridian, either to the north or south of the zenith.</p>

<p>5. To the southward of the dial are two buildings, named
<i>Ustuánah</i>. They exactly resemble one another, and are designed
for the same purpose, which is, to observe the altitude and azimuth
of the heavenly bodies. They are two in number, on
purpose that two persons may observe at the same time, and
so compare and correct their observations.</p>

<p>These buildings are circular; and in the centre of each is a
pillar, of the same height as the building itself, which is open at
top. From this pillar to the height of about three feet from
the bottom, proceed radii of stone, horizontally, to the circular
wall of the building.</p>

<p>6. Between these two buildings and the great equatorial dial
is an instrument called <i>shamlah</i>. It is a concave hemispherical
surface, formed of mason work, to represent the inferior hemisphere
of the heavens.</p>

<p>The best and most authentic account of the labours of Jayasinha
for the completion of his work and the advancement of
astronomical knowledge, is contained in his own preface to the
<i>Zeej Mahommedshahy</i>; from which the following extract is a
literal translation:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“To accomplish the exalted command which he had received,
he (Jey-sing) bound the girdle of resolution about the loins of his
soul, and constructed here (at Delhi) several of the instruments
of an observatory, such as had been erected at Samarcand,
agreeably to the <i>Musalman</i> books: such as <i>Zat-ul-huluck</i>, of
brass, in diameter three <i>guz</i> of the measure now in use (which
is nearly equal to two cubits of the Koran), and <i>Zat-ul-shobetein</i>,
and <i>Zat-ul-suchetein</i>, and <i>Suds-Fukheri</i>, and <i>Shamlah</i>. But
finding that brass instruments did not come up to the ideas that
he had formed of accuracy, because of the smallness of their
size, the want of division into minutes, the shaking and wearing
of their axes, the displacement of the centres of the circles, and
the shifting of the planes of the instruments; he concluded that
the reason why the determinations of the ancients, such as Hipparchus
and Ptolemy, proved inaccurate, must have been of
this kind; therefore he constructed in <i>Dar-ul-kheláfet</i>, <i>Shah-Jehanabad</i>,
which is the seat of empire and prosperity, instruments
of his own invention, such as <i>Jey-per-gàs</i> and <i>Ram-junter</i>,
and <i>Semrat-junter</i>, the semi-diameter of which is eighteen
cubits, and one minute on it is a barleycorn and a half, of stone
and lime, of perfect stability, with attention to the rules of
geometry and adjustment to the meridian, and to the latitude of
the place, and with care in the measuring and fixing of them;
so that the inaccuracies from the shaking of the circles, and the
wearing of their axes, and displacement of their centres, and the
inequality of the minutes, might be corrected.</p>

<p>“Thus an accurate method of constructing an observatory
was established; and the difference which had existed between
the computed and observed places of the fixed stars and planets,
by means of observing their mean motions and aberrations with
such instruments, was removed. And, in order to confirm the
truth of these observations, he constructed instruments of the
same kind in Sewaī Jeypoor, and Matra, and Benares, and
Oujein.”</p>

<p>After this most interesting visit to the Observatory, we
returned to Delhi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<h3>THE ZENĀNA.</h3>

<p>During my visit at Khāsgunge, Mr. James Gardner gave me
an introduction to one of the princesses of Delhi, Hyat-ool-Nissa
Begam, the aunt of the present, and sister of the late king.
Mr. James Gardner is her adopted son. The princess sent one
of her ladies to say she should be happy to receive me, and
requested me to appoint an hour. The weather was excessively
hot, but my time was so much employed I had not an hour to
spare but one at noon-day, which was accordingly fixed upon.</p>

<p>I was taken in a palanquin to the door of the court of the
building set apart for the women, where some old ladies met
and welcomed me. Having quitted the palanquin, they conducted
me through such queer places, filled with women of all ages;
the narrow passages were dirty and wet,—an odd sort of entrance
to the apartment of a princess!</p>

<p>Under a verandah, I found the princess seated on a <i>gaddī</i>, of a
green colour. In this verandah she appeared to live and sleep,
as her <i>charpāī</i>, covered with a green <i>razā’ī</i>, stood at the further
end. She is an aged woman; her features, which are good, must
have been handsome in youth; now they only tell of good
descent. Green is the mourning worn by the followers of the
prophet. The princess was in mourning for her late brother, the
Emperor Akbar Shah. Her attire consisted of trowsers of green
satin, an angiya, or boddice of green, and a cashmere shawl of
the same colour: jewels are laid aside during the days of <i>mātam</i>
(mourning). I put off my shoes before I stepped on the white
cloth that covered the carpet, and advancing, made my <i>bahut
bahut adab salām</i>, and presented a <i>nazr</i> of one gold mohur.
The princess received me very kindly, gave me a seat by her
side, and we had a long conversation. It is usual to offer a
gold mohur on visiting a person of rank; it is the homage paid
by the inferior to the superior: on the occasion of a second visit
it is still correct to offer a <i>nazr</i>, which may then consist of
a bouquet of freshly-gathered flowers. The compliment is
graciously received, this homage being the custom of the
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>I had the greatest difficulty in understanding what the Begam
said, the loss of her teeth rendering her utterance imperfect.
After some time, she called for her women to play and sing for
my amusement. I was obliged to appear pleased, but my
aching head would willingly have been spared the noise. Her
adopted son, the son of the present King Bahadur Shah, came
in; he is a remarkably fine, intelligent boy, about ten years old,
with a handsome countenance. Several other young princes also
appeared, and some of their betrothed wives, little girls of five
and six years old: the girls were plain. The princess requested
me to spend the day with her; saying that if I would do so, at
4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I should be introduced to the emperor (they think it an
indignity to call him the king), and if I would stay with her
until the evening, I should have nāches for my amusement all
night. In the mean time she desired some of her ladies to
show me the part of the palace occupied by the zenāna. Her
young adopted son, the heir-apparent, took my hand, and conducted
me over the apartments of the women. The ladies ran
out to see the stranger: my guide pointed them all out by
name, and I had an opportunity of seeing and conversing with
almost all the begams. A plainer set I never beheld: the
verandahs, in which they principally appeared to live, and the
passages between the apartments, were <i>mal propre</i>. The young
prince led me through different parts of the palace, and I was
taken into a superb hall: formerly fountains had played there;
the ceiling was painted and inlaid with gold. In this hall were
three old women on charpāīs (native beds), looking like hags;
and over the marble floor, and in the place where fountains once
played, was collected a quantity of offensive black water, as if
from the drains of the cook rooms. From a verandah, the
young prince pointed out a bastion in which the king was then
asleep, and I quitted that part of the palace, fearing the talking
of those who attended me, and the laughing of the children,
might arouse his majesty from his noon-day slumbers.</p>

<p>On my return to the princess I found her sister with her, a
good-humoured, portly-looking person. They were both seated
on chairs, and gave me one. This was in compliment, lest the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
native fashion of sitting on the ground might fatigue me.
The heat of the sun had given me a violent headache. I
declined staying to see the king, and requested permission to
depart.</p>

<p>Four trays, filled with fruit and sweetmeats, were presented
to me; two necklaces of jasmine flowers, fresh gathered, and
strung with tinsel, were put round my neck; and the princess
gave me a little embroidered bag filled with spices. It is one of
the amusements of the young girls in a zenāna to embroider
little bags, which they do very beautifully; these they fill with
spices and betel-nut, cut up into small bits; this mixture they
take great delight in chewing. An English lady is not more
vain of a great cat and kitten with staring eyes, worked by herself
in Berlin wool, than the ladies behind the parda of their skill
in embroidery. On taking my departure the princess requested
me to pay her another visit; it gave her pleasure to speak of
her friends at Khāsgunge. She is herself a clever, intelligent
woman, and her manners are good. I had satisfied my curiosity,
and had seen native life in a palace; as for beauty, in a whole
zenāna there may be two or three handsome women, and all the
rest remarkably ugly. I looked with wonder at the number of
plain faces round me.</p>

<p>When any man wishes to ascend the minarets of the Jāma
Masjid, he is obliged to send word to the captain of the gate
of the palace, that the ladies may be apprised, and no veiled
one may be beheld, even from that distance: the fame of the
beauty of the <i>generality</i> of the women may be continued, provided
they never show their faces. Those women who are
beautiful are very rare, but then their beauty is very great; the
rest are generally plain. In England beauty is more commonly
diffused amongst all classes. Perhaps the most voluptuously
beautiful woman I ever saw was an Asiatic.</p>

<p>I heard that I was much blamed for visiting the princess, it
being supposed I went for the sake of presents. Natives do not
offer presents unless they think there is something to be gained
in return; and that I knew perfectly well. I went there from
curiosity, not avarice, offered one gold mohur, and received in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
return the customary sweetmeats and necklaces of flowers.
Look at the poverty, the wretched poverty of these descendants
of the emperors! In former times strings of pearls and valuable
jewels were placed on the necks of departing visitors. When
the Princess Hyat-ool-Nissa Begam in her fallen fortunes put the
necklace of freshly-gathered white jasmine flowers over my head,
I bowed with as much respect as if she had been the queen of
the universe. Others may look upon these people with contempt,
I cannot; look at what they are, at what they have
been!</p>

<p>The indecision and effeminacy of the character of the emperor
is often a subject of surprise. Why should it be so? where is
the difference in intellect between a man and a woman brought
up in a zenāna? <i>There</i> they both receive the same education,
and the result is similar. In Europe men have so greatly the
advantage of women from receiving a superior education, and in
being made to act for, and depend upon themselves from childhood,
that of course the superiority is on the male side; the
women are kept under and have not fair play.</p>

<p>One day a gentleman, speaking to me of the <i>extravagance</i> of
one of the young princes, mentioned he was always in debt, he
could never live upon his allowance. The allowance of the
prince was twelve rupees a month!—not more than the wages
of a head servant.</p>

<p>With respect to my visit, I felt it hard to be judged by people
who were ignorant of my being the friend of the relatives of
those whom I visited in the zenāna. People who themselves
had, perhaps, no curiosity respecting native life and manners,
and who, even if they had the curiosity, might have been utterly
unable to gratify it, unless by an introduction which they were
probably unable to obtain.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that a native lady in a large house always
selects the smallest room for her own apartment. A number of
ladies from the palace at Delhi were staying in a distant house,
to which place a friend having gone to visit them, found them
all in the bathing-room, they having selected that as the smallest
apartment in which they could crowd together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>I will here insert an extract from the Delhi Gazette of
Jan. 13th, 1849.</p>

<p>“On Thursday morning, departed this life, Prince Dara
Bukht, heir-apparent to the throne of Delhi, and with him, we
have some reason to believe, all the right of the royal house to
the succession, such having been guaranteed to him individually,
and to no other member of the family. We sincerely trust
that such is really the case, and that our Government will now
be in a position to adopt steps for making efficient arrangements
for the dispersion, with a suitable provision, of the family on
the death of the present king. The remains of the deceased
prince were interred near Cheeragh Delhi within a few hours of
his death. It is a curious fact, that nearly all the native papers
have long since omitted the designation of ‘Padshah’ when
alluding to the King of Delhi, styling him merely ‘Shah.’”</p>

<p>It was too hot for me to venture round the walls of the
palace, and I only paid a flying visit to the <i>Dīwān-i-am</i>, or Hall
of Public Audience, and to the <i>Dīwān-i-khāss</i>, or Hall of Private
Audience. The latter is built of white marble, beautifully
ornamented, and the roof is supported on colonnades of
marble pillars. In this hall the peacock throne stands in the
centre; it is ascended by steps, and covered with a canopy, with
four artificial peacocks at the four corners. Around the exterior
of the <i>Dīwān-i-khāss</i>, in the cornice, is the well-known inscription,
in letters of gold, upon a ground of white marble: “If there be a
paradise on earth, it is this, it is this<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.” The terrace of this
building is composed of large slabs of white marble, and the
building is crowned at the top with four pavilions or cupolas of
the same materials.</p>

<p>The palace is 3000 feet long, 1800 broad, and at one time
would have held 10,000 horse: the building it is said cost
about £1,000,000 sterling.</p>

<p>The royal baths, a little to the northward of the <i>Dīwān-i-khāss</i>,
consist of three very large rooms, surmounted by domes
of white marble: adjoining to the baths is a fine mosque.</p>

<p>In the royal gardens is a very large octagonal room, facing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
the Jumna, called <i>Shah Burj</i>, or the Royal Tower, which is
lined with marble. Through the window of this room Prince
Mirza Juwaun Bukht made his escape in 1784, when he fled to
Lucnow. The Rohillas, who were introduced by Gholaum
Cadir Khan, stripped many of the rooms of their marble ornaments
and pavements.</p>

<p>It was my intention to have gone round the walls in the cool
of the evening, with my relative, but I was so much disgusted
with the ill-natured remarks I had heard, I would not enter the
place again.</p>

<p>The gardens of Shalimar are worthy of a visit, from which
the prospect to the south, towards Delhi, as far as the eye can
reach, is covered with the remains of extensive gardens,
pavilions, mosques, and burial-places. The environs of this
once magnificent city appear now nothing more than a heap of
ruins, and the country around is equally desolate and forlorn:—</p>

<p>“Within the city of New Delhi are the remains of many
splendid palaces, belonging to the great omrahs of the empire;
among the largest are those of Cummer-o’-deen Cawn, vizier to
Mahmud Shah; Ali Merdan Khan, the Persian; the Nawab
Gazooddeen Cawn; Seftur Jung’s; the garden of Coodseah
Begam, mother of Mahmud Shah; the palace of Sadut Khan;
and that of Sultan Darah Shekoah.”</p>

<p>“The baths of Sadut Khan are a set of beautiful rooms, paved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
and lined with white marble; they consist of five distinct apartments,
into which light is admitted by glazed windows at the
top of the domes. Sefdur Jung’s Teh Khana consists of a set
of apartments, built in a delicate style; one long room, in which
is a marble reservoir the whole length, and a smaller one raised
and balustraded on each side; both faced throughout with white
marble. Adjoining the palace is the fort of Selīm, <i>Selīm-garh</i>;
it communicates by a bridge of stone, built over an arm of the
river, and is now entirely in ruins.</p>

<p>“The modern city of Shāhjahānabad is rebuilt, and contains
many good houses, chiefly of brick; the streets are in general
narrow, as is usual in most of the large cities of Asia; but
there were formerly two very noble streets, the first leading to
the palace gate, through the city, to the Delhi gate, in a direction
north and south. This street was very broad and spacious,
having handsome houses on each side of the way, and merchants’
shops, well furnished with a variety of the richest articles.
Shāhjahān caused an aqueduct of red stone to be made, which
conveyed the water the whole length of the street, and thence,
by a reservoir underground, into the royal gardens. Remains of
this aqueduct are still to be seen, but it is in most parts choked
up with rubbish. The second grand street entered in the same
manner from the palace to the Lahore gate; it lay east and west,
and was equal in all respects to the former; but, in both of them,
the inhabitants have spoiled the beauty of their appearance by
running a line of houses down the centre; and, in other places,
across the street; so that it is with difficulty a person can
discover, without narrowly inspecting, their former position.”</p>

<p>“In the neighbourhood of the Cabul gate is a garden, called
Tees Huzzari Bagh, in which is the tomb of the Queen Malika
Zemani, wife of the Emperor Mahmud Shah. On a rising
ground near this garden, whence there is a fine prospect of the
city, are two broken columns of brown granite, eight feet high,
and two and a half in breadth, on which are inscriptions in
ancient characters.”</p>

<p>Near the Ajimere gate is a Madrasa, or college, erected by
Gazooddeen Cawn, nephew of Nizam-ool-Mooluk; it is built of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
red stone, and situated in the centre of a spacious quadrangle,
with a fountain, lined with stone. At the upper end of the area
is a handsome mosque, built of red stone, and inlaid with white
marble. This college is now uninhabited.</p>

<p>Modern Delhi has been built upon two rocky eminences; the
one where the Jāma Masjid is situated, named Jujula Pahar;
and the other called Bejula Pahar; from both of these you have
a commanding view of the rest of the city.</p>

<h3>THE JĀMA MASJID.</h3>

<p><i>24th.</i>—We visited this noble masjid,—the finest I have
seen; no difficulty was made in allowing us to inspect it. “The
gate of the house of God is always open<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>:” not only literally,
but also to converts.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This mosque is situated about a quarter of a mile from the
royal palace; the foundation of it was laid upon a rocky eminence,
named Jujula Pahar, and has been scarped on purpose.
The ascent to it is by a flight of stone steps, thirty-five in
number, through a handsome gateway of red stone. The doors
of this gateway are covered throughout with plates of wrought
brass, which Mr. Bernier imagined to be copper. The terrace
on which the mosque is situated is a square, of about fourteen
hundred yards of red stone; in the centre is a fountain, lined
with marble, for the purpose of performing the necessary ablutions
previous to prayer.</p>

<p>“An arched colonnade of red stone surrounds the whole of
the terrace, which is adorned with octagonal pavilions for sitting
in. The mosque is of an oblong form, two hundred and sixty-one
feet in length, surmounted by three magnificent domes
of white marble, interspersed with black stripes, and flanked by
two <i>minarets</i> of black marble and red stone alternately, rising to
the height of an hundred and thirty feet. Each of these
minarets has three projecting galleries of white marble, having
their summits crowned with light octagonal pavilions of the
same. The whole front of the building is faced with large slabs
of beautiful white marble; and along the cornice are ten compartments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
four feet long, and two and a half broad, which are
inlaid with inscriptions in black marble, in the <i>Nishki</i> character;
and are said to contain the greater part, if not the whole, of the
<i>Koran</i>. The inside of the mosque is paved throughout, with
large slabs of white marble, decorated with a black border, and
is wonderfully beautiful and delicate; the slabs are about three
feet in length, by one and a half broad. The walls and roof are
lined with plain white marble; and near the <i>kibla</i> is a handsome
<i>taak</i>, or niche, which is adorned with a profusion of frieze-work.
Close to this is a <i>mimbar</i> or pulpit of marble, which has an
ascent of four steps, balustraded. <i>Kibla</i> literally implies compass,
but here means a small hollow or excavation in the walls
of Muhammadan mosques, so situated on the erection of the
buildings as always to look towards the city of Mecca.</p>

<p>“The ascent to the minarets is by a winding staircase of an
hundred and thirty steps of red stone; and, at the top, the
spectator is gratified by a noble view of the King’s Palace, the
Cuttub Minar, the Hurran Minar, Humaioon’s Mausoleum, the
Palace of Feroze Shah, the Fort of old Delhi, and the Fort of
Loni, on the opposite bank of the river Jumna. The domes
are crowned with cullises of copper, richly gilt; and present a
glittering appearance from afar off. This mosque was begun by
the Emperor Shāhjahān, in the fourth year of his reign, and
completed in the tenth. The expenses of its erection amounted
to ten lākh of rupees; and it is in every respect worthy of being
the great cathedral of the empire of Hindūstan.”—<span class="smcap">Franklin.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Exclusive of the mosques before described, there are in Shāhjahānabad
and its environs above forty others; most of them of
inferior size and beauty, but all of them of a similar fashion.
In the evening, we drove to the Turkoman gate of the city, to
see the Kala Masjid or Black Mosque. We found our way with
difficulty into the very worst part of Delhi: my companion had
never been there before, and its character was unknown to us;
he did not much like my going over the mosque, amid the
wretches that surrounded us; but my curiosity carried the day.
The appearance of the building from the entrance is most singular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
and extraordinary; it would form an excellent subject for
a sketch. You ascend a flight of stone steps, and then enter
the gateway of the masjid: the centre is a square; the pillars
that support the arches are of rude construction,—stone placed
upon stone, without mortar between; there are twelve or fifteen
small domes on three sides of the square. I wished to sketch
the place, but my relative hurried me away, fearful of insult
from the people around. The masjid was built four hundred and
fifty years ago, before the building of the modern Delhi. The
tradition of the place is this:—</p>

<p>In former times the masjid was built of white stone. A
father committed a horrible crime within its walls. The stones
of the masjid turned from white to black. It obtained the
name of the black mosque. No service was ever performed
there, and the spot was regarded as unholy: none but the
lowest of the people now frequent the place; and any stranger
visiting it might as well take a barkindāz as a protection against
insult. Hindoo Rāo, the brother of the Bāiza Bā’ī, lives near
Delhi, in the house of the late Mr. Frazer; he came in his
curricle to call on Captain S⸺: I saw him; he is a short,
thick-set, fat Mahratta, very independent in speech and bearing.
After some conversation, he arose to depart, shook hands with
me, and said, “How do you do?” thinking he was bidding me
“good night.” This being all the English he has acquired, he
is very fond of displaying it. Some young officer, in a fit
of tamāshā (<i>i.e.</i> fun) must have taught him his “How do
you do.”</p>

<p>There is no guide-book to conduct a stranger over the city of
Delhi, or to point out the position of its numerous gates; I have
therefore added a plan of the city, which we found very useful
when arranging our excursions, and I have made numerous
extracts from Franklin to point out places worthy of a visit<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Quitted Delhi, and encamped the first march at Furrudnagar
on our return to Meerut; it was too hot for tents.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Encamped at Begamabad: I was very unwell; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
annoyance of thieves around my tent, and the greater plague of
fever, kept me awake all night.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Was driven into Meerut the whole march, being
unable to sit on my horse; called in medical aid, and was confined
for six days to my charpāī, unable to rise from fever, influenza,
and severe cough.</p>

<p><i>March 11th.</i>—Just able to creep about. Captain A⸺
drove me to see the tomb of Aboo, a very fine one near the prison
at Meerut: its history I forget, and I was too ill to attempt to
sketch it.</p>

<p>Thence we drove to the tomb of Pīr Shāh, near the gate of
the city. It is in ruins; the verandah that once ornamented
it has fallen to the ground. The tomb is peculiar, the dome
has only been raised two feet and so finished: this has been so
left purposely, that the sunshine and the dews of heaven may
fall on the marble sarcophagus of the saint who sleeps within
the building. Around the tomb are a number of the graves of
the faithful. Perhaps the exertion of taking a drive made me
ill again; and the relative with whom I was staying not
admiring this return of fever, determined to take me instantly
to the hills.</p>

<p>1838, <i>March 16th.</i>—We drove out twenty miles, to the place
where the palanquins awaited us, travelled dāk all night, found
a buggy ready for us at the last stage, and reached our friend’s
house at Saharanpūr the next morning by 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> On the road,
about five o’clock in the morning, I was much delighted with
the first view of the snowy ranges; I never anticipated seeing
mountains covered with snow again, and, as I lay in my palanquin,
watching the scene for miles, breathing the cool air from
the hills, and viewing the mountains beyond them, I felt quite a
different being, charmed and delighted. Mr. and Miss B⸺
received us very kindly; and I had the pleasure of meeting an
old friend, Captain Sturt, of the engineers;—the man whose
noble conduct distinguished him so highly, and who was shot
during the fatal retreat of the army in Afghānistan. In the
evening we visited the Botanical Garden; it is an excellent one,
and in high order; some tigers were there, fiercely growling over
their food, several bears, and a porcupine. The garden is well
watered by the canal, which passes through it. The Governor-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
broke up his camp at Saharanpūr, and quitted, with a
small retinue, for Mussoorī, the day before we arrived.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—We took leave of our friends, and resumed our dāk
journey at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; during the night we passed Lord Auckland’s
camp, which was pitched in a very picturesque spot at Mohunchaukī:
the tents, the elephants, and the camels formed beautiful
groups among the trees, and I stopped the palanquin a short time
to admire them. We passed through a forest,—or sāl jangal, as
they call it,—in which wild elephants are sometimes found, and
met with a little adventure: a tiger was lying by the road-side; the
bearers put down the palanquin, waved their torches, and howled
and screamed with all their might: the light and noise scared
the animal,—he moved off. I got out of the palanquin to look
at a tiger <i>au naturel</i>, saw some creature moving away, but could
not distinguish what animal it was; the bearers were not six
feet from him when they first saw him; it was a fine, clear,
moonlight night. The jangal looked well, and its interest was
heightened by the idea you might now and then see a wild beast.
A number of fires were burning on the sides of the hills, and
running up in different directions; these fires, they tell me, are
lighted by the zamīndars, to burn up the old dry grass; when that
is done, the new grass springs up, and there is plenty of food for
the cattle; the fires were remarkable in the darkness of the
night. For some miles up the pass of Keeree, our way was over
the dry bed of a river; on both sides rose high cliffs, covered
with trees; the moonlight was strong, and the pass one of great
interest; here and there you heard the noise of water, the
pleasing sound of a mountain stream turning small mills for
grinding corn, called <i>Panchakkī</i>. In the morning we arrived at
the Company’s bungalow at Rajpūr.</p>

<p>Rajpūr is situated at the foot of the Hills: I was delighted
with the place; the view from the bungalow put me in mind of
Switzerland. We went to Mrs. Theodore’s hotel, to see her
collection of stuffed birds and beasts; a complete set costs
1600 rupees (£160). At the bottom of the valley between the
Hills I heard the most delightful sound of rushing waters: taking
a servant with me, I went down the steep footpath, irresistibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
attracted by the sound, and found the mountain rill collected
into a mill-dam, from which, rushing down, it turned several
mills; and one of the streams was turned off into the valley,
forming the little cascade, the sound of which had attracted me.
How bright, clear, cold, and delicious was the water! Being too
unwell to bear the fatigue of climbing the hill, I sent for a hill-pony,
called a <i>gūnth</i>; he was brought down; the little fellow
never had a woman on his back before, but he carried me
bravely up the sheep-path, for road there was none. Motī, the
name of the handsome gūnth, is an iron-grey hill-pony,—more
like a dwarf-horse than a pony; he has an exceedingly thick,
shaggy mane, and a very thick, long tail;—the most sure-footed
sagacious animal; he never gets tired, and will go all day up
and down hill; seldom fights, and is never alarmed when
passing the most dangerous places. Give your gūnth his head,
and he will carry you safely. Horses are dangerous,—even the
most quiet become alarmed in the hills. Captain S⸺ bought
this gūnth at the Hurdwar fair; he came from Almorah,
cost 160 rupees (£16); and 300 rupees have been refused for
him.</p>

<p>The following history was related to me concerning the gūnth:—Colonel
P⸺, to whom the animal was lent, took him to
the Snowy Ranges; “In some pass, by some accident, the
gūnth fell down a precipice, and was caught upon an oak tree.
There he swung; one struggle would have sent him to the
bottom, and to certain death; he never moved. Colonel P⸺,
who was walking at the time, got some people, who descended
to the place where the gūnth hung, dug out a standing-place in
the side of the hill, just big enough to hold the pony, and contrived
to get him off his tree into the spot: the gūnth was so
much alarmed, that they left him to recover from his fright on
this spot the whole night; and the next morning got him up the
precipice in safety to the road.” Any horse would have struggled
and have been killed; these gūnths appear to understand
that they must be quiet, and their masters will help them. He
is a queer-tempered little fellow; he kicked my sā’īs over
one day, and always kicks at me if I attempt to pat him; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
he carries me capitally: nevertheless, he is “vicious as he is
little<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.”</p>

<p>The whole day I roamed about Rajpūr; the <i>Paharīs</i> (the
Hill-men), who had come down to bring up our luggage, were
animals to stare at: like the pictures I have seen of Tartars,—little
fellows, with such flat ugly faces, dressed in black woollen
coarse trowsers, a blanket of the same over their shoulders; a
black, greasy, round leather cap on their heads, sometimes decorated
all round their faces with bunches of Hill-flowers, freshly
gathered; a rope round their waists. Their limbs are stout,
and the sinews in the legs strongly developed, from constantly
climbing the Hills. They are very honest and very idle;
moreover, most exceedingly dirty. Such were the little Hill
fellows we met at Rajpūr.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—This morning the gūnth came to the door for my
companion to ride up the Hills: I was to be carried up in a
jampān. A jampān is an arm-chair, with a top to it, to shelter
you from the sun or rain; four long poles are affixed to it.
Eight of those funny little black Hill fellows were harnessed
between the poles, after their fashion, and they carried me up
the hill. My two women went up in dolīs, a sort of tray for
women, in which one person can sit native fashion; these trays
are hung upon long poles, and carried by Hill-men. The ascent
from Rajpūr is seven miles, climbing almost every yard of the
way. The different views delighted me: on the side of the Hills
facing Rajpūr the trees were stunted, and there was but little
vegetation; on the other side, the northern, we came upon fine
oak and rhododendron trees—such beautiful rhododendrons!
they are forest trees, not shrubs, as you have them in England.
The people gathered the wild flowers, and filled my lap with
them. The jangal pear, in full blossom, the raspberry bushes,
and the nettles delighted me; I could not help sending a man
from the plains, who had never seen a nettle, to gather one; he
took hold of it, and, relinquishing his hold instantly in excessive
surprise, exclaimed,—“It has stung me; it is a scorpion plant.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Violets were under every rock; and the wild, pleasing notes of
the Hill birds were to be heard in every direction. The delicious
air, so pure, so bracing, so unlike any air I had breathed for
fifteen years,—with what delight I inhaled it! It seemed to
promise health and strength and spirits: I fancied the lurking
fever crept out of my body as I breathed the mountain air; I
was so happy, so glad I was alive; I felt a buoyancy of spirit,
like that enjoyed by a child.</p>

<p>The only bungalow we could procure was one on the top of
the hill of Landowr; it was an uncomfortable one, but a roof
was not to be despised in such cold weather: we had a fire
lighted instantly, and kept it burning all day. Where now was
the vile fever that had bowed me down in the plains? It had
vanished with the change of climate, as if by magic. The Hill
air made me feel so well and strong, we set off on our ponies in
the evening to visit Mr. E⸺’s house; it is beautiful, built
with great taste, and highly finished; its situation is fine, on a
hill, at the further end of Landowr. Thence we went to Colonel
P⸺’s bungalow, a good house, well situated, but very far
from supplies; he offered it to me for the season for 1200 rupees—<i>i.e.</i>
£120 for seven months. From the barracks, at the top
of Landowr, the view of the Snowy Ranges is magnificent.
In any other country these <i>hills</i> would be called mountains; but,
being near the foot of the Himalaya, that in the distance tower
above them, they have obtained the title of “The Hills.”
Landowr, Bhadráj, Ben Oge, are covered with oak and rhododendron
trees; the valleys between them, by the Hill people called
<i>khuds</i>, are extremely deep: at the bottom of these khuds water
is found in little rills, but it is very scarce. About two thousand
feet below Landowr water is abundant, and there are some
waterfalls. The Hills are very grand, but have not the picturesque
beauty of the valley of Chamouni:—and yet it is unfair
to make the comparison at Landowr; Chamouni is at the foot
of Mont Blanc: to compare the two, one ought to proceed
to the foot of the Snowy Ranges, where their solitary
grandeur would overpower the remembrance of Mont Blanc. I
long to go there: the difficulties and privations would be great;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
I could not go alone, and the fatigue would be excessive; nevertheless,
I long to make a pilgrimage to Gangotrī, the source
of the Ganges.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Started on our ponies at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to ride to Mussoorī,
which is only a short distance from Landowr. The scenery
at that place is of a tamer cast; the southern side of the hill,
on which most of the houses are situated, puts me in mind of
the back of the Isle of Wight, but on a larger scale; the
projecting rocks and trees, with gentlemen’s houses in every
nook, all built on the side of the hill, give the resemblance.
The northern side is called the Camel’s Back, from a fancied
resemblance of the hill to the shape of that animal; there the
scenery differs entirely. The southern side, on which Mussoorī
is situated, has few trees, and looks down on the valley of the
Dhoon; the northern side is covered with fine trees, the hills
abrupt; a wildness and grandeur, unknown on the southern side,
is all around you; the valleys fearfully deep, the pathway
narrow, and in some parts so bad, only one foot in breadth is
left for a pony. At first I felt a cold shudder pass over me, as
I rode by such places; in the course of a week I was perfectly
accustomed to the sort of thing, and quite fearless. A pathway
three feet in width at its utmost breadth, is a handsome road in
the Hills; a perpendicular rock on one side, and a precipice,
perhaps three or four hundred feet deep, may be on the other.
It is all very well when the road is pretty open; but when you
have to turn the sharp corner of a rock, if looking over a
precipice makes you giddy, shut your eyes, and give your gūnth the
rein, and you will be sure to find yourself safe on the other side.
The little rascals never become giddy; and after a short time you
will turn such corners at a canter, as a thing of course. I was
delighted with the wildness of the scenery,—it equalled my
expectations. In front of Mussoorī you are in high public, the
road called the Mall is from eight to ten feet wide, covered with
children, nurses, dogs, and sickly ladies and gentlemen, walking
about gaily dressed. I always avoid the Mall; I go out for enjoyment
and health, and do not want to talk to people. The children!
it is charming to see their rosy faces; they look as well and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
strong as any children in England; the climate of the Hills is
certainly far superior to that of England. Not liking my bungalow,
I changed it for another half way up the hill of Landowr.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Lord Auckland and the Misses Eden arrived to-day,
and took up their residence at Colonel Young’s, a little below,
on the hill of Landowr.</p>

<p>From my bungalow the view is beautiful, and we have as
much air as man can desire. The first thing was to get pardas,
stuffed with cotton, for every window and door; the next, to
hire a set of Hill-men, to cut and bring wood from the khuds,
and water and grass for the ponies. A long ride round Waverly
was the evening’s amusement; then came a dinner of excellent
Hill-mutton, by the side of a blazing fire of the <i>beautiful rhododendron
wood</i>! The well-closed doors kept out the cold, and
my kind relative congratulated me on having lost my fever, and
being so comfortable in the Hills.</p>

<p>Visited Mr. Webb’s hotel for families; it is an excellent one,
and very commodious. There is a ball-room, and five billiard
tables with slate beds; these slate beds have only just arrived in
India, and have very lately been introduced in England.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—During the time I was waiting for my relative, who
had accompanied Lord Auckland, to show him the hospital and
the different buildings at Landowr, which were under his charge,
my attention was arrested by a great number of Hill-men, carrying
large bundles of moss down to the plains; they grind up the
moss with barley-meal, and use it as soap; it is in great repute
at weddings.</p>

<p>Rode my little black horse, but found him not so pleasant in
the Hills as a gūnth, and more fatiguing. At the foot of
Landowr there is an excellent bazār: every thing is to be had
there,—<i>Pâtée foie gras</i>, <i>bécasses truffés</i>, <i>shola</i> hats covered with
the skin of the pelican, champagne, bareilly couches, shoes,
Chinese books, pickles, long poles for climbing the mountains, and
various incongruous articles. Many years ago, a curious little
rosary had been brought me from the <i>santa casa</i> of our Lady of
Loretto;—a fac-simile of the little curiosity was lying for sale in
the Landowr bazār, amongst a lot of Hindūstanī shoes!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>The Governor-General and his party quitted Landowr, and
returned to Rajpūr, on their march to Simla, up the valley of
the Deyra Doon.</p>

<p>In the evening I rode out to see Ben Oge and Bhadráj: at the
foot of Ben Oge is a boys’ school; a number of little fellows
were out at play. There is also a girls’ school at Mussoorī.
Here English children can receive some education in a fine
climate.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—Rainy; thermometer in the verandah at noon, 56°;
at 3 o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> 54°.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—The Hills covered and hidden by deep clouds; thunder
and lightning, with some rain. Thermometer, 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> 46°;
evening fine, heavy rain at night.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Captain E. S⸺ has an estate in the Hills, called
Cloud End,—a beautiful mountain, of about sixty acres, covered
with oak trees: on this spot he had long wished to build a
house, and had prepared the plan, but his duties as an engineer
prevented his being long enough at a time in the Hills to accomplish
the object. I offered to superintend the work during his
absence, if he would mark out the foundation: a morning’s ride
brought us to his estate, situated between a hill, called “the
Park,” and Ben Oge, with Bhadráj to the west; the situation is
beautiful,—the hills magnificent and well-wooded. Having
fixed on the spot for the house,—the drawing-room windows to
face a noble view of the Snowy Ranges,—the next thing was to
mark a pathway to be cut into the Khud, a descent of two
miles, for the mules to bring up water.</p>

<p>The plan of the house was then marked out, and a site was
selected for my hill-tent, commanding a view of the Himalaya:
this little tent was made to order at Fathīgarh,—it is twelve feet
square, the walls four feet high, and has two doors. A stone
wall is to be built around it, a chimney at one end, and a glass
door at the other; a thatch will be placed over it, and this will
be my habitation when I go to Cloud End, or when I make
excursions into the Hills; my kitchen will be an old oak tree.
The Hills are so steep, a single pole tent of the usual size can be
pitched in very few places. Under an old oak, on a rock covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
with wild flowers, I sat and enjoyed the scene: the valley of the
Doon lay stretched before me, and the Hills around me. There
is a rhododendron tree on this estate that bears <i>white</i> flowers,—it
is a great rarity, and highly prized; all the flowers of the
other rhododendron trees are of a magnificent crimson. The
Hill-men are fond of sucking the juice from the petals, which,
it is said, possesses an intoxicating quality.</p>

<p>Stormy-looking clouds were rolling up from the valley towards
the Hills: returning home, we were caught in as fine a storm as
I almost ever beheld; it was a glorious sight,—the forked
lightning was superb, the thunder resounded from hill to hill,
the hail and rain fell heavily: for about two hours the storm
raged. We took shelter in a Europe shop; towards night it
decreased; wrapped in black blankets, which we procured from
the bazār, we got home in safety; the rain could not penetrate
the black blankets, the wool of which is so oily. The storm
raged with violence during the night, but I heard it not: in the
morning the Hill-tops were covered with snow: at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the
thermometer 38° in the verandah; in the room at noon with a
fire it stood at 57°.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—My relative left me, taking back all useless servants,
and the camels from Rajpūr.</p>

<p>Visited the Hospital, of which Mr. Morrow is the steward, to
see his collection of birds. The specimens are very well preserved
with arsenical soap, and they sell well on that account:
he had two pair of the Moonāl pheasants alive, their plumage
bright and beautiful. The collection was large; I selected only
a few specimens, as follows:—</p>

<p>The Golden Eagle of the Himalaya: a bird I have often seen
flying around Landowr; and a remarkably fine one. Also the
Black Eagle of these mountains.</p>

<p>The Loonjee, or Red Pheasant, from the deep forests of the
Himalaya: a bird rare and valuable; the skin on the neck is
peculiar; in confinement they are timid and quiet, but the light
annoys them, from being accustomed to the shade of the
forests.</p>

<p>The Moonāl, Duffeah, or Blue Pheasant of the Himalaya:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
these birds are brought from the interior; they are seldom found
so far down as Landowr; nevertheless, one was shot at Cloud
End, Bhadráj; they are timid at first in confinement,—after a few
days, they will eat wheat in your presence, and show no signs of
alarm. The eggs they lay when in cages might be brought to
England; why should they not thrive in our climate, since they
are inhabitants of a cold region? The hen-bird, although less
splendid in plumage than the cock, is very game.</p>

<p>The Koklás Pheasant, common in the Hills, is also a very
game-looking bird.</p>

<p>The Callinge Pheasant, with its peculiar top-knot, is, as well as
those before mentioned, excellent food. Other pheasants are found
in the Himalaya, of which I was unable to procure specimens.</p>

<p>Black Partridges: the most beautiful in the world are found
in most parts of India; they are a great delicacy.</p>

<p>The Chakor, or Red-legged Partridge: very similar to the
French Partridge; excellent food: they may be rendered so tame,
they will run about the house and garden. Chakor, the
Bartavelli, or Greek Partridge (Perdix chukar, Gould.; Perdix
rufa, Lath): said to be enamoured of the moon, and to eat fire
at the full of the moon. This bird is also called ātash-khwār (fire-eater),
a variety of Tetrao rufus, Lin.; called, in Hindī, Chakor.
It is also denominated “Moon Bird,” and “Minion of the
Moon.” The common grey partridge is coarse and inferior.</p>

<p>Bush Quail and Rock Quail: beautiful and delicious. When
buying a number of quail, which are caught in nets, you will
rarely find a cock bird, if caught near Lucnow, or any
native court; they are taken out, and sold as fighting birds.
Quail are numerous all over India, and generally sold twenty-five
per rupee.</p>

<p>A Jangal Cock and Hen: the wild cock and hen of the woods,
common over all India; the stock to which all common fowls
owe their origin. There are various kinds of fowls in India;
the ghāgas are large, fine, and very long legged, like game birds;
the chatgaiyān are fine also; the karaknāth are considered very
delicate by the natives, but the purple colour of their bones has
a disagreeable appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>Green Pigeons: beautiful birds. Blue Pigeons: which
inhabit the wells; it is said the fare of an aide-de-camp is
“hard work and <i>blue pigeons</i>!”</p>

<p>The Barbet, the Blackbird, the Blue-winged Jay, the Long-tailed
Blue Jay, the Woodpecker, Humming Birds, the Shah
Humming Bird, the Mocking Bird, and the Cuckoo, whose
note is delightful in the Hills, recalling thoughts of early youth
and home.</p>

<p>The Chand Chuck, the King Crow: a most courageous little
fellow, who fights and bullies all the crows in admirable style:
hence his name, King Crow.</p>

<p>Flycatchers, Dhobī Birds, Magpies, and the Rana Chiriyā:
the colour of the cock is a brilliant scarlet; that of the ranee,
the hen-bird, is a bright yellow. They appear during the hot
winds.</p>

<p>The Mango Bird: so called as they are seen during the
mango season.</p>

<p>The Rocket Bird: with the most elegant long white feathers
in its tail.</p>

<p>The birds brought from the interior by the Paharīs must
have the moss taken out with which they are stuffed, and be prepared
with arsenical soap; otherwise, the feathers will fall off.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Some Hill-men brought me two pair of the Moonāl
pheasants alive; I bought them. They eat wheat, and live
very quietly in their cages.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Spent the day at Cloud End, overlooking the workmen.
The mountain on which they are building the house
will supply almost all the materials: the stones, which are
cut out of it for the walls of the house, are at first so soft,
they appear to be rotten; but exposure to the air will harden
them in a fortnight. The beams are from the old oak trees;
the lime is burned from the stones; but the slates are to be
brought from a neighbouring mountain; and the frames for
the doors and windows will be procured, ready-made, from
Rajpūr.</p>

<p>The day was very hot, but the breeze delightful: returning
home, I was seized with illness, and my pulse being one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
and twenty, called in medical aid. It is not agreeable to be
suffering from illness, on the top of a mountain, far away
from all one’s friends,—depressed, and out of spirits, with
nothing to amuse one but the leeches, hanging, like love-locks,
from one’s temples.</p>

<p>A recovery from illness is a pleasant state, where you have
around you beautiful scenery and pure air. The Hills have
all that secret treasury of spots, so secluded, that you seem to
be their first discoverer; lonely glens and waterfalls, on which
the sun’s rays scarcely rest one hour in the twenty-four;
cold hidden basins of living water; and all so shut out from
intrusion of the human race, that, in spirit, you become blended
with the scene.</p>

<p><i>April 16th.</i>—Spent the day at Mr. E⸺’s: in the evening,
as we were going down the hill, which is exceedingly steep,
I was so nervous, from recent fever, that I could not ride down
the descent; therefore the gūnth was led, and I walked. The
pathway, or rather sheep-track, not one foot in breadth, is
covered with loose stones, and on the edge of a precipice.
Miss B⸺ rode down perfectly unconcerned. From the
bottom of the Khud I rode up the next hill, to see a house,
called Newlands; which has been struck and burned three
times by lightning. The hill is said to contain a quantity of
iron, which attracts the electric fluid. A lady and her ayha
were killed there by the lightning. On my return I rode up
the hill I had not had the courage to ride down; even that was
enough to make me nervous, after having suffered from recent
fever so many days. A short time ago, as Major Blundell
was going to that very house, Newlands, by some accident, his
gūnth fell over the precipice, and they were both dashed to
pieces. At one place I dismounted, and climbed the side of the
bank, whilst the servants held the gūnths during the time
three mules had to pass them. The passing was effected with
great difficulty, and one of the mules was nearly over the precipice,
so narrow was the pathway.</p>

<p>1838, <i>April 17th.</i>—Started on my gūnth, the day being cloudy
and cold, to make a call some miles off down the hill, at
Jerrīpānī. The elevation of Jerrīpānī is much less than that
of Landowr, and the difference in the vegetation remarkable:
here, the young leaves of the oaks are just budding,—there, they
are in full leaf; here, the raspberry is in flower,—there, in fruit.</p>

<p class="noindent">was at Jerrīpānī in beautiful profusion, sometimes hanging its
white clusters over the yellow flowers of the barbery. The
woodbine delighted me with its fragrance, and the remembrance
of days of old; and the rhododendron trees were in full grandeur.
Near one clump of old oaks, covered with moss and ivy, I
stopped to listen to the shrill cries of the cicala, a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
transparently-winged beetle: the sounds are like what we might

</figure>

<p>The road was remarkably picturesque, the wind high and cold—a
delightful breeze, the sky cloudy, and the scenery beautiful:
I enjoyed a charming ride, returned home laden with wild
flowers, and found amusement for some hours, comparing them
with Loudon’s Encyclopedia. A pony, that was grazing on the
side of Landowr close to my house, fell down the precipice, and
was instantly killed: my ayha came to tell me that the privates
of the 16th Lancers and of the Buffs ate horseflesh, for she had
seen one of them bring up a quantity of the pony’s flesh in a
towel;—I ventured to observe, the man might have dogs to
feed.</p>

<h3>VIEW FROM THE PILGRIM’S BANGLĀ.</h3>

<p><i>19th.</i>—The view from the verandah of my banglā or house is
very beautiful: directly beneath it is a precipice; opposite is
that part of the hill of Landowr on which stands the sanatorium
for the military, at present occupied by the invalids of the 16th
Lancers and of the Buffs. The hill is covered with grass, and
the wild potato grows there in profusion; beyond is a high steep
rock, which can only be ascended by a very precipitous path on
one side of it; it is crowned by a house called Lall Tība, and is
covered with oak and rhododendron trees. Below, surrounded
with trees, stands the house of Mr. Connolly; and beyond that,
in the distance, are the snow-covered mountains of the <i>lower</i>
range of the Himalaya. The road—if the narrow pathway,
three feet in breadth, may deserve so dignified an appellation—is
to the right, on the edge of a precipice, and on the other side
is the perpendicular rock out of which it has been cut. This
morning I heard an outcry, and ran to see what had happened;
just below, and directly in front of my house, an accident had
occurred: an officer of the Buffs had sent a valuable horse down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
the hill, in charge of his groom; they met some mules laden
with water-bags, where the path was narrow, the bank perpendicular
on the one side, and the precipice on the other; the
groom led the horse on the side of the precipice, he kicked at
the mules, his feet descended over the edge of the road, and
down he went—a dreadful fall, a horrible crash; the animal was
dead ere he reached a spot where a tree stopped his further
descent: the precipice is almost perpendicular.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Found a glow-worm of <i>immense</i> size on the side of the
hill: a winged glow-worm flew in, and alighted on the table; it
is small, not a quarter the size of the other.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—During the night, some animal came into the verandah,
killed one of the Moonāl hen pheasants, and wounded the cock
bird so severely that he will die. There is a wild-beast track on
the side of the hill opposite my house, along which I have
several times seen some animal skulking in the dusk of the
evening.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Accompanied some friends to breakfast in my cottage-tent
at Cloud End. We laid out a garden, and sowed flower
seeds around the spot where my little tent is pitched, beneath
the trees; while thus employed, I found a scorpion among the
moss and leaves where I was sitting, which induced me to repeat
those lines of Byron:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The mind that broods o’er guilty woes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is like the scorpion girt by fire,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In circle narrowing as it glows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The flames around their captive close,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till, inly search’d by thousand throes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And maddening in her ire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One sad and sole relief she knows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sting she nourish’d for her foes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose venom never yet was vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gives but one pang, and cures all pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And darts into her desperate brain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>My memory was a source of woe to the scorpion at Bhadráj;
they surrounded him with a circle of fire; as the heat annoyed
him he strove to get over the circle, but the burning charcoal
drove him back; at last, mad with pain, he drove his sting into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
his own back; a drop of milk-white fluid was on the sting, and
was left on the spot which he struck; immediately afterwards
the scorpion died: Mr. R⸺ saw him strike the sting into
his own back. When it was over we felt a little ashamed of our
scientific cruelty, and buried the scorpion with all due honour
below the ashes that had consumed him: a burnt sacrifice to
science. In a note in “the Giaour,” the idea is mentioned as
an error, of the scorpion’s committing suicide, but I was one of
the witnesses to the fact.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Saw a fine mule for sale for £10, and bought him immediately
for my own riding; mules are generally very safe on these
dangerous roads. Also purchased two smaller ones for the estate
for £9, water-bags and all. A man brought a number of fine fat
Karral sheep, fit for table, from the interior, where they are
fattened on acorns; I purchased four of them for twenty-four
rupees eight ānās; the mutton is delicious; they have short
tails and large horns, are very strong, and their fleeces, long and
warm, are suited to their own hill climate.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—The weather constantly fine, cool, and pleasant; we
have a little fire lighted merely in the morning and evening.
Purchased Sancho, a handsome retriever, from a private in the
Lancers.</p>

<p><i>May 1st.</i>—My friend Mrs. B⸺ and her four children have
arrived; I invited them to come and stay with me; the children
are most interesting,—nevertheless, their noise drives me half
crazy; my life has been so perfectly quiet and solitary of late,
the change makes my head ache.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 6th.</i>—Unable to go to church at Mussoorī; constant
rain, very cold and chilly; the clouds are hanging over the
mountains in white heavy masses, or drifting on this powerful
wind up the valleys, or rather between the ridges of the Hills.
I went into the verandah, to see if the Italian greyhounds were
warmly housed, and could not help exclaiming, “How delicious
is this coldness in the Hills!—it is just as wet, windy, and
wretched as in England:” thus mingling the recollected misery
of a wet, raw day in England, and the delight of a cold day
in India. The boys are calling me to have a game of marbles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
with little apples,—the small sweet apples we get from
Meerut.</p>

<p>My mule, who has been christened Don Pedro, carries me
beautifully; we canter and trot up and down hill at an excellent
pace; he has but one fault,—a dangerous one in the Hills,—that
of shying; he would be worth two hundred rupees if he
were not timid.</p>

<p>The conical form of The Hills is their great peculiarity; in
order to gain sufficient level ground, on which to build the house
at Bhadráj, it was necessary to cut off the top of the hill,—a work
of labour and expense. A khud is a valley between two hills,
which is generally very narrow, so much so, that a horse might
leap across the bottom of several of the khuds I have seen near
Landowr. The building of the house at Cloud End has proceeded
at a great rate; five hundred Hill-coolies are constantly employed
under the eye of an European, to keep them at their work. The
house has been roofed in, and my relative has come up from
Meerut, to have the slates put on after some peculiar <i>hikmat</i>
(fashion) of his own.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—The storm of yesterday rendered the air so pure and
clear, it was most refreshing; I mounted my mule, and went to
spend the day at Bhadráj. The Snowy Ranges were distinct and
beautiful, the wild flowers lovely on every rock; the ride was
one of great enjoyment. The wild notes of the Hill birds were
heard in every direction, and the cuckoo was sending forth its
old familiar note. On my arrival I found one of the ponies at
the estate had been killed by a fall over the precipice when
bringing up water from the khud.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—Capt. S⸺ says, a very severe earthquake was felt
at his estate during the storm the other night: he was asleep in
the outer building, and was awakened by the shock, which threw
down the gable end of it; fortunately, the large stones fell
outwards, or he would have been killed on his bed; he ran out,
and took refuge in the little tent. The shock also split open the
stone wall of the mule-shed. Although his estate is only six
miles off, we did not feel the earthquake at Landowr.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—My fair friend and myself having been invited to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
pic-nic at a waterfall, about two thousand feet below Landowr,
we started on our gūnths at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; the tents, servants, and
provisions had gone on the day before; none of us knew the
way, but we proceeded, after quitting the road, by a footpath
that led up and down the steepest hills; it was scarcely possible
for the gūnths to go over it. At 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we arrived, completely
tired, and found an excellent breakfast ready. The waterfall
roared in the khud below, and amidst the trees we caught
glimpses of the mountain torrent chafing and rushing along.
After breakfast the gentlemen went out to explore the path to
the waterfall; we soon grew too impatient to await their return,
and followed them.</p>

<p>We descended into the khud, and I was amusing myself jumping
from rock to rock, and thus passing up the centre of the brawling
mountain stream, aided by my long <i>paharī</i> pole of <i>rous</i> wood, and
looking for the picturesque, when my fair friend, attempting to
follow me, fell from the rocks into the water,—and very picturesque
and very Undine-like she looked in the stream! We
returned to the tents to have her garments dried in the sun, and
while the poor little lady was doing penance, I wandered down
the stream, of which the various waterfalls are beautiful; and,
although there was a burning sun on the top of the Hills, down
below, by the water, it was luxuriously cool. The path I took
was straight down the torrent; I wandered alone for three hours,
refreshing myself with wild strawberries, barberries, raspberries,
and various other Hill fruits that hung around the stream on
every side. The flowers were beautiful, the wild ferns luxuriant,
the noise of the torrent most agreeable,—in fact, all was charming.
On my return, I found the party at the foot of a beautiful
waterfall, eighty feet in height; the spot was lovely, it was
overhung with trees, from the topmost boughs of which gigantic
climbers were pendant. How gaily did we partake of excellent
wine and good fare on that delicious spot! It was nearly sunset
ere we mounted our gūnths, and took the path through the
village of Būttah.</p>

<p>This village is inhabited by Hill people; I saw a very good-looking
woman at a cottage door, in a very picturesque dress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
and wished to go and speak to her, but was deterred from so
doing, as the Hill-men appeared to dislike the gentlemen passing
near the village: I must go alone some day, and see her again.
By mistake we lost the path, and got into paddy fields, where
we were obliged to dismount, and take the ponies down the most
dangerous places. My fair companion was on a mare from the
plains; we were obliged to tie a rope to the animal, and leap her
down those places over which the ponies scrambled; we went down
the dry bed of a torrent for some distance, and it was most curious
to see how the gūnths got over and down the rocks. Walking
fatigued me to excess; I mounted my gūnth, and rode up some
frightful places, up the bed of a small torrent, where there was
no path; the gūnth clambered up the rocks in excellent style.
Presently Mrs. B⸺ thought she would do the same; she had
not been on the mare ten minutes when I heard a cry, “The
mem sāhiba has fallen into the khud!” Her horse had refused
to clamber up a rocky ascent, I suppose she checked him, he
swerved round, and fell down the khud; fortunately he fell on
his right side, therefore her limbs were above him, and they
slipped down together, the horse lying on his side, until, by the
happiest chance, his downward course was stopped by a tree.
The sā’īses ran down, pulled her off, and brought her up the
Hill; afterwards they got the horse up again in safety. But
for the tree, the lady and her steed would have been dashed to
pieces; she was bruised, but not much hurt. Her scream
alarmed me,—I thought it was all over. We returned completely
tired; but the day had been one of great delight, the
scenery lovely, and the air delicious.</p>

<p>From Landowr, looking towards Hurdwar, the isolated Hill
of Kalunga or Nālāpanī, with its table-land and Fortress on the
highest extremity, is visible. When the steady coolness and
bravery of the Ghoorkas, united with insurmountable obstacles,
compelled our troops to fall back, General Gillespie determined
to carry the place; and, at the head of three companies of the
53rd Regiment, reached a spot within thirty yards of a wicket
defended by a gun; there, as he was cheering the men,—waving
his hat in one hand, and his sword in the other, he was shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
through the heart, and fell dead on the spot. Thus died as
brave and reckless a cavalier as ever put spur on heel; his
sword is one of the interesting relics of my museum. I never
meet a hardy, active little Ghoorka, with a countenance like a
Tartar, and his kookree at his side, but I feel respect for him,
remembering the defence of Kalunga. The women showed as
much bravery as the men; showers of arrows and stones were
discharged at the enemy: the women threw the stones dexterously,—severe
wounds were inflicted by them; and they
undauntedly exposed themselves to the fire of the enemy;
they acted with the natural courage inherent in us all, never
having been taught that it was pretty and interesting to be
sweet, timid creatures! Perhaps, after all, the noble conduct of
these Ghoorka women may be traced to a reason given by a
modern European author, who covertly asserts, that women,
not having souls as men have, are guided in all their actions by
instinct! The Hindūs are equally complimentary, and assert,—“A
woman cannot be kept in due subjection, either by gifts, or
kindness, or correct conduct, or the greatest services, or the
laws of morality, or by the terror of punishment,—for she cannot
discriminate between good and evil!”</p>

<p>The kookree is a semicircular, long, heavy knife, always
carried by the Ghoorkas; sometimes the sheath is curiously
embroidered with strips from the quill of the peacock’s feather:
two small crooked knives are generally in the same sheath.
The kookree is used for war as well as for all domestic
purposes.</p>

<p>The sword used by the Ghoorka officers called a “korah,” or
a “bughalee,” is also used by the executioners in China for
decapitation, with a back-handed drawing cut.</p>

<p>The sling used by Hill-men is made of a thick long cord of
worsted, having a little breadth in the centre, in which, having
placed the stone, they whisk the sling round, and launch it.
Specimens of all these weapons I brought from the Hills. The
sling above described was doubtless used by the Ghoorka women
at Kalunga.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—We mounted our gūnths so early we were at Cloud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
End by 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to breakfast. Ben Oge, the hill adjoining, is the
highest point at Mussoorī. The day was bright and clear.
Captain S⸺ asked us to ride to the summit; he accompanied
us on foot. The view from the top of Ben Oge was beautiful:
the Snowy Ranges were so clear and distinct, you could see
every peak. I thought of Captain Skinner’s journal as I looked
at the peaks of Jumnotrī, the source of the Jumna, and
traced the river as it wound below through the khuds at the foot
of the mountains, its course doubling like a hare. Beyond
was the Peak of Gangotrí, from which the Ganges rises. I
longed to march into the interior, to behold the grandeur of the
scenery of the Himalaya. Ben Oge is quite treeless at the
summit, but the ground was covered with wild lavender, thyme,
and various mountain flowers of great beauty, while numberless
butterflies flitted over them. My relative found the breeze very
chilly, but the sun was so hot it made my head spin; we
returned to his house: he was seized with cholera, from the
heat of his body being suddenly checked by the cold air, and
the sun pouring on his head; he was very ill, and in great pain
for two hours. We returned home, determined not to ascend
another hill during the heat of the day.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—My little widow and I were out riding at seven in the
morning; on our return we were surprised to find a very severe
earthquake had been experienced at Landowr and Mussoorī,
which had frightened all the people; there were three distinct
shocks. We on our gūnths did not feel the shocks; there are
but few hours in the day in which an earthquake could catch us
off our ponies.</p>

<p>I have never put on a bonnet since I came to the Hills; like
the steeds in the “Lay of the Last Minstrel,” which “stood
saddled in stable day and night,” so am I saddled in my hat
and riding-habit, always on my pony; my visits are made on
horseback. I have a jampan, (a sort of chair, with poles, carried
by Hill-men,) but this is a disagreeable kind of conveyance; and
I like the independence of my pony much better. The earthquake
was charming; we seem to have all the eccentricities of nature
around us. A Landowr Ætna or Vesuvius would figure well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
in my journal, could we be lucky enough to discover a burning
mountain in these Snowy Regions.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—I gave a pic-nic party by the side of a mountain
stream, in a deep khud at Jerrīpānī: the barberries were quite
ripe, in shape much thicker than the English, in colour black,
very good in taste. The wild dog-rose hung its clusters of white
flowers from almost every tree in the richest profusion;—it is a
beautiful climber.</p>

<p><i>June 1st.</i>—The weather is hot during the middle of the day,
the thermometer 70°; one cannot go out with comfort, unless
the day be cloudy or stormy; it is very hot for the Hills.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—A very hot day;—the Hills covered with a fog-like
smoke, occasioned by the burning of the jangal in the valley
below; hot and smoky air comes up in volumes. Mrs. M⸺
was riding this evening, when a leopard seized her spaniel, which
was not many yards in front of her pony; the shouts of the
party alarmed the animal, and he let the dog drop; however,
the poor spaniel died of his wounds. Some officers laid wait
for the leopard, and shot it; I saw it, coming up the Hill,
fastened on a bamboo, to be stuffed and prepared with arsenical
soap.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—Mr. D⸺ invited us to a pic-nic at Bhadráj; we
selected a spot under a fine oak tree on the estate at Cloud End;
numberless amusements were provided for us: a champagne
tiffin was pleasant under the old oak tree; and a dinner, rich
and rare, finished the amusements of the day. When the moon
arose we mounted our gūnths; and, as the road lay through
the dark shade of trees, and on the edge of precipices, we
determined to be careful, and agreed to muster three times on
our journey of six miles, to see that none of the party had fallen
into the khud. Away we cantered through the beautiful moonlight,
almost racing our ponies. At the last muster, Mr. H⸺
was thrown by his mule; but as he was scarcely hurt, it was only
a laughing matter. We reached home at half-past eleven, after
a beautiful ride and a pleasant day.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—One of the officers of the Buffs met a bear the other
day, and was glad to get off unhugged; bears as well as leopards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
abound in the Hills. I must not take my pet dog out riding
with me; at this time of the year wild beasts are numerous, and
render it dangerous.</p>

<p>We have a great number of visitors every day in the Hills;
people have nothing to do but to run about calling and amusing
themselves. A third earthquake has taken place; but, as usual,
I on my gūnth was unconscious of the quaking of the earth.
A storm of thunder, lightning, and hail has cooled the air, and it
is very pleasant weather. The Hills look so beautiful at night,
when they are on fire; the fire never spreads, but runs up to the
top of the Hill; they fire them below in several places at once, to
burn the old long grass, and make way for the new to sprout up.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—A letter from Allahabad tells me, a most severe storm
took place there on the third of this month,—more severe than
the one in which the Seagull was wrecked; it only lasted an
hour. It blew down one of the verandahs of our house, unroofed
the cow-house, the meat-house, the wild-duck-house, the
sheep-house, &amp;c.: the repairs will not cost us less than seven
hundred rupees (£70).</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Accompanied Mr. R⸺ to see the Botanical Garden,
which is small, but interesting: I ate cherries from Cashmere,
saw a very fine Hill lily from the interior, and gathered many
beautiful flowers. Some peaches, from the Dhoon valley, very
large and fine, like English peaches, were sent me to-day.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Our party being engaged to dine at Cloud End to-day,
under the old oak tree, we got up at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, when we found the
Hills covered with thick white clouds from the bottom of the
khuds to their summits; the clouds were so thick, and we were
so completely in the midst of them, you could not see beyond
the verandah; the thunder rolled, and the sheeted lightning
flashed. After a while the wind blew off the clouds, and the
Hills re-appeared, but only for a few moments, when fresh
clouds rolled up from the valley, and every thing was again
hidden in the white foggy cloud. The rain fell heavily, straight
down from the heavens: I trust the rains have set in this day;
without them the famine, and the sickness which is raging in
the plains below, will continue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>This specimen of what the rains will prove has quite horrified
my fair friend, and she is wishing herself back again at Meerut.
I—who am fond of storm and tempest—have enjoyed the day;
I like these hurly-burly scenes; too frequent repetition might
perhaps render them annoying, and the dampness might be productive
of rheumatism. Thermometer 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> 69°.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—At half-past 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> our party were at Cloud End, seated
on the rocks under the old oak, enjoying breakfast after the ride.
The delicious mountain air made me feel so well, I proposed to
Captain A⸺ to visit the summit of Bhadráj, seven miles off.
The rest of the party thought the exertion too great, and would
not join us. On quitting the made road we entered a track on
the side of the mountain, overhanging a deep precipice. We
lost our way, and found we could neither turn our mules round,
nor proceed any further. We dismounted; Captain A⸺,
with some difficulty, turned my mule; he then attempted to do
the same to his own,—the animal became skittish, and, slipping
from his hand, went down the side of the hill; how he kept his
feet was wonderful. The mule looked quietly up at us from
below; to have attempted to catch him would have sent him
down the rock to certain death, we therefore walked off, leaving
this most beautiful mule, for which £20 had just been paid, to
his fate. As we expected, when he found the other mule had
gone off, he ascended the rock with the utmost caution, and
rejoined his companion; I was glad to see his bridle in his
master’s hand again.</p>

<p>After much toil we arrived at the flag-staff on the top of the
hill; thence the view was such as is seldom seen in such perfection,
even in these mountains:—looking down towards the plain
of the Deyra Dhoon, instead of the beautiful valley in all its
emerald green, intersected by rivers pouring down from the
Hills,—instead of this, white clouds entirely filled the plain,
giving it the appearance of being filled with hills covered with
snow; beyond were the dark hills of the Lower Range; the next
minute the clouds changed their appearance, and rushed up the
Hills on a strong wind, covering several mountains at a time
in a most extraordinary manner with volumes of white cloud;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
then, driving on, left them bright in the sunshine. The river
Jumna, in the khud or valley, at times visible, at times concealed
by clouds, wound its tortuous course below. I have seen
the Hills under almost all forms, but the grandeur of the view
on this stormy day exceeded any thing I had before beheld, and
well repaid the fatigue. At times it rained a little, at times there
was a scorching sunshine, then came gusts of wind and clouds,
wrapping every object around us in dense white vapour. A little
further on we found a Hindū idol, rudely cut in stone; this idol
is now neglected, but was formerly much worshipped. Near it
is a large stone, on which is chiselled, “Lady Hood, 1814:” on
speaking of this to the political agent, he laughed and said,
“You were more enterprising than Lady Hood; you visited the
spot,—she only sent a man to chisel out her name, and that of
Colonel B⸺ on the top of Bhadráj; she never visited the
place in person.” We returned to dinner at Cloud End: how
glad we were of a glass of champagne after our fatigues! and
how glad we were we had brought the beautiful mule back in
safety! After tea, remounting our steeds, we returned to Landowr:
I rode in the course of that day twenty-six miles, up and
down hill,—a pretty good distance for a lady;—but who can feel
fatigue in the bracing, most enjoyable air of these delightful
mountains?</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—At twenty-two minutes after 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, an earthquake
shook the ground and the house; I was sitting at table and felt
the shocks, which were very powerful. Rain, rain, storms,
storms, thunder and lightning daily: truly, saith the proverb,
“There are storms in high places.”</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—A delightful day! How fine, how beautiful are the
Snowy Ranges! In consequence of the heavy rain the roads
have become very rotten and dangerous; in many parts, half
the road has fallen into the khud; and where the path is often
not three feet in width, it leaves but a small space for a man on
his gūnth. Mr. T⸺, of the artillery, met with a serious
accident this morning; the road was much broken, and as he
attempted to ride over it, it gave way; he and his pony went
down the precipice. Mr. T⸺ was stopped in his descent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
after he had gone one hundred feet, by a tree, was brought up,
and carried to a surgeon. He was much hurt in the head, but
is expected to recover in two or three weeks; no bones were
broken: the pony went down two hundred and fifty feet, and
was found alive!</p>

<p>One of my men was brought in for medical aid, he had
been employed in charge of a gang of Hill-men, cutting slates
for the roof of the new house, in a deep khud, and had
caught a fever. The slates found in the Hills are very good,
but more brittle than those of Europe. The houses formerly
were all thatched at Landowr; a thatched roof is dangerous on
account of the lightning which so often strikes and sets fire
to it. Captain S⸺ introduced slated roofs, and several
people have followed the good example he has set them.</p>

<h3>THE KHARĪTĀ</h3>

<p><i>1838, June 29th.</i>—Her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī did me the
honour to send me a <i>kharītā</i>, that is, a letter enclosed in a long
bag of <i>kimkhwāb</i>, crimson silk, brocaded with flowers in gold,
contained in another of fine muslin: the mouth of the bag was
tied with a gold and tasselled cord, to which was appended the
great seal of her Highness,—a flat circular mass of sealing-wax,
on which her seal was impressed. Two smaller bags were sent
with it, as represented in the plate, each containing a present of
bon-bons. The kharītā, as well as one of the small bags, is
represented divested of its outer case of transparent muslin; the
other little bag has on its white cover, and the direction is
placed within the transparent muslin. The autograph of the
Bāiza Bā’ī is on the right hand side of the page; the letter was
written in <i>Urdū</i> (the court language), in the Persian character,
by one of her Highness’s mūnshīs, and signed by the Bā’ī
herself: the paper is adorned with gold devices. The letter
commenced in the usual complimentary style; after which her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
Highness writes, that—“The light of my eyes—the Gaja Rājā—has
been very ill; she has recovered, and her husband, Appa
Sāhib Kanulka, having heard of her illness, has come from
Gwalior to see her.” Kharītās of this sort pass between the
mighty men of the East, and between them and the public
functionaries of Government.</p>

<p><i>July 3rd.</i>—I rode over to Cloud End, inspected the new
house, and trained young convolvulus plants over the bamboo
hedge around the garden: the rain descended in torrents; it was
very cold and uncomfortable. At 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, being anxious to get
home before dark, although it was still raining, I ordered my
gūnth; my relative wrapped me up in his military cloak, and
put a large Indian-rubber cape above it; in this attire I hoped
to keep myself dry during my ride home of seven miles. I
had not proceeded a mile from the estate when the storm came
on in the fearful style of mountain tempests; the thunder burst
roaring over my head, the lightning spread around in sheets of
flame, and every now and then the flashes of forked lightning
rendered me so blind I could not see the path for some minutes.
I had two servants with me; they walked before the gūnth, but
were unable very often to trace the road, it was so dark amidst
the trees, and the whole time the rain fell in torrents. I saw a
dark space in front of the horse, and asked, “What is that?”
“Oh, nothing,” said the sā’īs, “ride on.” But I stopped, and
sent him forward. At this spot three or four trees had been
thrown across a precipice; over these earth had been laid to
some depth to form a road; the earth had been entirely washed
away by the force of a stream of water, produced from the
heavy rain, and had fallen into the precipice:—the darkness was
the hollow produced by the chasm! I dismounted; the trees
were still below, across the hollow; with difficulty I clambered
down, got over the trunks, and up the other side; it was almost
perfectly dark. I called the gūnth; the cunning little fellow
looked at the hollow, stamped his fore-feet on the ground as if
he disliked it, sprang up the bank on the other side, and was in
safety by me. I remounted him and proceeded,—an act that
required a good deal of quiet courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“The darkness of the night is a collyrium to the eyes of the
mole<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.” It certainly was not to mine: after I had been out two
hours I found that I had advanced four miles on a path that
was covered by high trees on every side, rendering it the more
dangerous; the lightning was very vivid, and I saw a flash
strike the roof of a house; suddenly a faintness came over me,
with difficulty I kept in my saddle, and feeling ill, I desired the
servant to lead the gūnth to the first gentleman’s house he came
near. As soon as we arrived at a bungalow we went up to the
verandah, when an officer, hearing a lady was exposed to such a
storm, and wished for shelter, came out and took me into the
house: I was so much exhausted, the tears ran down my
face, and I almost fainted away. They gave me wine, and took
off the Indian-rubber cloak, which, most likely, was the cause
of the extreme oppression that overcame me.</p>

<p>The lady and gentleman in whose house I had taken refuge
were very kind; dry clothes soon replaced my wet habit, and
they gave me a bed; however, I was far too much excited to go
to sleep, and was disturbed by queer sounds in an outhouse, not
far from my sleeping room. I got up, opened my door, wished
to call my host, but not knowing his name, lay down again and
listened. In the morning the mystery was explained: a lady
staying at the house had two she-asses for her baby, which were
in an outhouse near my room; the night before my arrival a
leopard had broken into the outhouse in which the donkeys
were fastened, and had killed them both; they were found dead
with their halters on. The night I was there the leopard came
again, tore one of the carcases from the halter, and carried it
down the khud;—this was the strange noise that prevented my
sleeping. Quite a night of adventures. The carcases had been
left on purpose, and some of the officers of the Buffs were to
have laid wait for the leopard that night, but the storm prevented
their quitting their houses.</p>

<p>Captain S⸺ came to Landowr the next day: he was surprised
at my having passed the broken road in the darkness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
the storm; even by daylight, he passed over it with difficulty—perhaps
the darkness aided me, as it prevented my being
giddy.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—Rode to the Botanical Gardens; observed several
young tea plants, which were flourishing. The bright yellow
broom was in full flower; it put me in mind of the country by
the sea-side at Christchurch, Hants, where the broom is in
such luxuriance. We feasted on Cashmere apricots, which,
though not to be compared to those of Europe, were agreeable
to the taste.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—Storms, storms,—rain, rain,—day by day,—night by
night: thermometer at noon, 66°.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—A bear having been killed, I procured several bottles
of bear’s grease. Apricot oil was recommended also for the
hair.</p>

<p>I bought some Dēodar oil, made from the white cedar; the
smell is vile; it is good for rheumatic pains; if rubbed in <i>too
much</i> it will produce a blister.</p>

<p>Baskets full of currants were brought for sale; they were only
fit for tarts. Fresh figs, pretty good, were sent me, also some
tolerable pears of good size. Tar, called cheer-ke-tel, is
excellent in the Hills.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Was persuaded to go to a ball given by the bachelors
of Landowr and Mussoorī, an event in my quiet life. Cholera
has appeared in the bazār: the Hill-men are so much alarmed
that they run away from service. My paharīs came to request
I would let them all depart and pay them their wages: this I
refused to do: they pleaded their fear of the cholera. At
length they agreed to remain, if I would give them a kid to
sacrifice to the angry goddess who resides in the mountain,
and whom they believe has brought the illness amongst them—they
are extremely superstitious. What can you expect
from uneducated men? “If grass does not grow upon stones,
what fault is it in the rain<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>?”—<i>i.e.</i> it is unreasonable to
expect learning from him who has not the means or capacity
to acquire it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p><i>August 17th.</i>—As to our military movements, something will
be done, and danger is to be anticipated; but Russia will not
be so foolish as to enter heartily into the quarrels of Persia.
As for the Persians,—bah! I spit upon them, as Hājī Baba tells
us they say of us. I was amused by a letter in the paper to-day,
which, speaking of the Russian Invasion, says, “We are
being <i>hemmed</i> in all round like a pocket-handkerchief, and like
it coming to <i>blows</i>.” Are they afraid the bloodthirsty and
ambitious Nicholas should push us from our stools and rob us
of our salt? Eating the Company’s salt is the native mode of
expression for their wages of labour done under it.</p>

<p>Preparations for war are going on. Fifteen thousand men
from Bengal, and ten thousand from Bombay are to march to
Cabul, and defend that part of India in case of an attack from
Russia and Persia. Burmah and Nepaul are looking hostile;
we shall have war in abundance shortly. The Mahrattas talk
about the “Russes;” indeed the whole bazār at Allahabad is
full of it; they would have even a worse time with these <i>Cupidons
du Nord</i>, as the French called the Cossacks, than even
with us, resumption regulations included.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—For the last three weeks we have had rain night and
day; sometimes it has cleared in the evening for two hours;
any thing more unpleasant you cannot well imagine; certainly
the rains are very disagreeable in the Hills.—Another plague.—The
houses swarm with fleas. At first they did not attack me;
for the last few nights I have hardly closed my eyes on account
of their sharp fierce bites; they will worry me into a fever.
To counterbalance this plague we have no musquitoes; and the
climate is too cold to render a pankha necessary. How often
have I remembered a poetical epistle of Mr. W. S. Rose’s,
beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“These cursed fleas, they bite and skip so,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this Island of Calypso!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Hill-men say there is a certain stone which possesses a
charm and keeps away fleas; this stone they put into their
beds, and vow it keeps off the biters. My ayha tells me she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
borrowed the charm, and put it into her bed, the fleas were
nevertheless as ravenous as ever; she says the stone has the
smell of a peach.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” said I to my darzī, who was one
day groping about the floor with something in his hand, “Trying
to find my needle with this <i>iron-stone</i>; there is plenty of it
in the Hills.” Shortly afterwards the needle, attracted by the
magnetic qualities of the iron-stone, stuck to it; and the darzī
brought it to me in triumph. <i>Sang-i-miknātīs</i> is the native
name for loadstone.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Two of my fat sheep have been stolen: an officer in
the engineers has given me a fine Hill dog, by name Khobarah;
he must be chained in the sheep-house.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Another fat sheep has disappeared: according to the
shepherd, carried off by an hyena,—according to my belief,
sold to the butcher.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—We are blessed with a gleam of sunshine, and the
man is off with his net to catch butterflies; this fine day will
tempt them forth.</p>

<p>A Hill-man brought in a basket of fresh <i>kajgee</i>, walnuts;
they were a novelty; we cracked them, Hill fashion, between the
door and the sill, and found them excellent, sweet, and fresh.</p>

<p>The <i>paharīs</i> brought down curious-looking white stones,
which they called <i>booteah chharrā</i>, and used as shot. According
to their account these stones are found in a waterfall, and
brought from Almorah. On first inspection they have the
appearance of being a mineral crystallization, but on more
minute examination, it will be found that the number of faces
or flattened sides is irregular, some having eight, others nine,
ten, or eleven faces. On splitting one open as shown in the
plate entitled “<a href="#plate42">Jugunnath</a>,” Fig. 7, which represents the two
halves, a beautiful little round kernel presents itself, enclosed in
the outer case. It is very probable, therefore, that they are the
ripe seeds or berries of some tree or plant in the vicinity, which,
falling into, or being washed by the rains into some water highly
impregnated with carbonate of lime, become petrified, and
entirely changed into this substance, which frequently happens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
under the supposed circumstances. The little flattened faces
may thus be accounted for, by the pressure of the grains in
their conglomerated state against one another, at the time the
berries are either in a soft or ripe state; at any rate, they are now
simple carbonate of lime, completely dissolving in diluted muriatic
acid, with evolution of carbonic acid, and without sediment.</p>

<p>In the plate above mentioned (Fig. 6) the grains are represented
<i>en masse</i>, about half their proper size. Fig. 8 represents
them exactly the size of the original; one is split open, showing
the centre of the rays. Fig. 7 is a grain split open, showing the
beautiful little white polished berry,—if berry it be.</p>

<p>I have numerous specimens of leaves and branches of trees
from Almorah, petrified in the waterfalls, covered with a thick
white or brownish crust, through which the fibres of the leaves
can be distinctly traced.</p>

<p>Amongst other curiosities in the Hills, I must not omit the
flexible stone; Major S⸺ showed me a large specimen, which
was decidedly flexible. Since I have applied myself to lithography,
it appears to me that the stone we cut out of his mountain at
Cloud End, Landowr, with which his house was built, had
greatly the appearance of the German lithographic stone; I
well remember thinking it <i>rotten</i> when first cut out, and finding
it hardened completely on exposure to the air in ten days or a
fortnight: I know not if this peculiarity belong to the lithographic
stone. The latter dissolves completely in <i>muriatic acid</i>,
and water, leaving no sediment.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—A most fearful storm during the night,—one that was
sufficient to make me quit my bed, to look after my little widow
and the bābās, <i>i.e.</i>, children. The paharīs informed me a
few days ago that the banglā or thatched house in which I am
living has been three times struck by lightning, and twice burned
to the ground!—an agreeable reminiscence during so violent
a storm. As the lightning, if it strike a house, often runs
round the walls of a room, from the iron of one wall shade
to that of another, and then pursuing its course down to the
grate, tears out the bars, and descends into the earth, we took
the precaution of sitting in the centre of the room, avoiding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
sides. My fair friend laughed, in spite of her alarm, when I
repeated the old verses:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ellen, from lightning to secure her life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draws from her pocket the attractive knife;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But all in vain, my fair, this cautious action,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For you can never be without attraction.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Sept. 1st.</i>—A most delightful day,—sunshine, absolute sunshine,—the
Hills so gay and beauteous after the deluge of so
many weeks: the ponies came to the door, and we enjoyed the
day to its fullest extent. Some leaf butterflies were caught and
brought to me; they are very large and curious,—the back of
the wing is like two autumnal leaves laid upon one another. It
is said that every month the appearance of the leaf butterfly
changes, varying with the leaves. Those that were caught for
me were like autumnal leaves, and were of two kinds. I made
a large collection of butterflies, both at Allahabad and in the
Hills; in the latter place many rare and valuable sorts are
found. The <i>Map</i> butterfly, so called from the map-like tracery
on its wings, is difficult to catch, it flies so high; it is very
beautiful. The large black butterfly, that has four brilliant
purple eyes on its wings, is perhaps as handsome as any; but it
has a rival in the emerald green long-tailed one, whose under
wings are dashed with purple, and edged with rose-coloured
spots. There is also a long-tailed black butterfly, the upper
wings of which exhibit stripes of black and white, while the under
ones have seven rose-coloured spots and four white marks in the
centre. I am told the most valuable are the small purple ones
with long tails. It were too long a task to enumerate the various
beautiful specimens procured for me of these “insect queens of
eastern spring.” The privates of the Lancers and Buffs added
to my collection, and were very anxious to give their butterflies
in return for the beer brewed in the Hills; which, though it
cannot be compared to Bass’s or Allsopp’s Pale Ale, is very fair,
when you consider it is country made.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—A letter informed me of the bursting of the Mahratta
Bāndh at Allahabad: the Ganges poured through the gap, inundating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the whole country, until it reached the Jumna just above
the Fort, leaving the latter completely insulated. Our house,
being close to the bank of the Jumna, escaped, but was on every
side surrounded by water. M. mon mari had two large boats
anchored near, to receive himself, his horses, his flocks, and his
herds, should the river rise any higher. The Bāndh burst on the
23rd of August; it swept away the villages of Kyd and Mootī
Gunge, carrying away all the thatched huts, the brick houses
alone escaping. The Jumna rose to within seven feet of the top
of the very high bank on which the <i>chabūtara</i> (terrace) in our
garden is placed. The damage done to the crops and villages is
estimated at four lākh; besides this, the force of the water rushing
upon the bastion of the Fort has caused it to fall in; it will
cost forty or fifty thousand rupees to repair the bastion.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—Ill: my ayha is so kind and so careful of me: what a
good servant I find her! <i>Apropos</i>—grain is at present very dear
at Landowr; gram, twelve seer per rupee.</p>

<p>“One wife is enough for a whole family<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.” “Where do you
live?” said I to one of my servants, a Paharī (mountaineer),
who had just deposited his load of rhododendron wood, or,
as he calls it, flower wood, in the verandah. “Three days’
journey from this, in the pahar (mountain,)” said the man.
“Are you married?” said I. The man looked annoyed; “Who
will marry me? How can I have a wife? there are but three of
us.” Having heard of the singular customs of the Paharīs
with regard to marriage, I pursued my interrogation. “Why
cannot you marry?” “We are only three brothers; if there
were seven of us we might marry, but only three, who will
marry us?” The greater the number of the family the more
honourable is the connexion, the more respected is the lady.
“But who claims the children?” “The first child belongs to
the eldest brother, the second to the second brother, and so on,
until the eighth child is claimed by the eldest brother, if there
be a family of seven.”</p>

<p>I have heard that the Hill women destroy their female<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
offspring, thinking the lot of woman too hard to endure. The
price of a wife is high, from the scarcity of women, and may
account for the disgusting marriages of the Paharīs.</p>

<p>Mr. Vigne, in his travels in Cashmir, remarks,—“My classical
companion pointed out to me the following passage of Cæsar’s
Commentaries, showing that a similar custom existed amongst
the Ancient Britons:—‘Uxores habent deni duodenique inter
se communes, et maxime fratres cum fratribus, et parentes cum
liberis. Sed si qui sunt ex his nati, eorum habentur liberi, a
quibus primùm virgines quæque ductæ sunt.’”—<i>Cæsar, de
Bello Gallico</i>, lib. v. cap. 14.</p>

<p>I am told that honesty was the distinguishing characteristic in
former times of the Paharīs, but intercourse with civilized
Europeans has greatly demoralized the mountaineers.</p>

<p><i>1838, Sept.</i>—You wish me to send home some sketches from
the Hills; I will strive to comply with the request, and in the
mean time will forward you a map, copied from a portion of a
survey: it will show you the elevation of the Himalaya, and
give you a definite idea of the shape of the mountains.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT PEAK OF BHADRINĀTH.</h3>

<p>The highest peak, that of Bhadrināth, 23,441 feet above the
Sea, is a conspicuous object from the summit of Landowr.
Some of the mountains of the Snowy Ranges display high,
rocky, sharp peaks, covered with snow—smooth, hard, unbroken,
and glittering white; others are cut into fantastic shapes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
There are no glaciers, because, in all probability, an uniform
cold—below the freezing point—prevails in so elevated a region.
Bhadrināth is a noted place of pilgrimage, and during my stay
in the Hills some of my Hindū servants requested leave of
absence to visit it.</p>

<p>“The Hindūs have a way to heaven without dying: if the
person who wishes to go this way to heaven, through repeating
certain incantations survive the cold, he at last arrives at Himalŭyŭ,
the residence of Shivŭ. Such a person is said ‘to go the
Great Journey:’ Yoodhist’hirŭ, according to the puranŭs, went
this way to heaven; but his companions perished by the cold on
the mountain: this forms another method in which the Hindūs
may meritoriously put a period to their existence; it is also one
of the Hindū atonements for great offences.” The ceremonies
performed on visiting holy places are as follows:—“When a
person resolves to visit any one of these places, he fixes upon an
auspicious day, and, two days preceding the commencement of
his journey, has his head shaved; the next he fasts; the following
day he performs the shraddhŭ (funeral obsequies) of the
three preceding generations of his family on both sides, and
then leaves his house. If a person act according to the shastrŭ
he observes the following rules:—First, till he returns to his
own house, he eats rice which has not been wet in cleansing,
and that only once a day; he abstains from anointing his body
with oil, and from eating fish. If he ride in a palanquin or in a
boat he loses half the benefits of his pilgrimage; if he walk on
foot he obtains the full fruit. The last day of his journey he
fasts. On his arrival at the sacred spot, he has his whole body
shaved, after which he bathes, and performs shraddhŭ: if the
pilgrim be a woman, she has only the breadth of two fingers of
her hair behind cut off; if a widow, her whole head is shaved.
It is necessary that the pilgrim stay seven days at least at the
holy place; he may continue as much longer as he pleases.
Every day during his stay he bathes, pays his devotions to the
images, sits before them, and repeats their names, and worships
them, presenting such offerings as he can afford. In bathing,
he makes kooshŭ grass images of his relations, and bathes them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
The benefits arising to relations will be as one to eight, compared
with that of the person bathing at the holy place. When he is
about to return, he obtains some of the offerings which have
been presented to the idol or idols, and brings them home to
give to his friends and neighbours; these consist of sweetmeats,
toolŭsee leaves, the ashes of cow-dung, &amp;c. After celebrating
the shraddhŭ he entertains Brahmāns, and presents them with
oil, fish, and all those things from which he abstained: having
done this he returns to his former course of living. The reward
promised to the pilgrim is, that he shall ascend to the heaven of
that god who presides at the holy place he has visited.”</p>

<p>The mighty Bhadrināth towers far above Chimboraco,
although—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“⸺Andes, giant of the western star,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With meteor-standard to the winds unfurl’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looks from his throne of clouds o’er half the world.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Gangoutrī, the source of the most sacred branch of the
Ganges, Mahadēo sits enthroned in clouds and mist, amid rocks
that defy the approach of living thing, and snows that make
desolation more awful. But although Gangoutrī be the most
sacred, it is not the most frequented shrine, access to it being
far more difficult than to Bhadrināth; and, consequently, to
this latter pilgrims flock in crowds, appalled at the remoteness
and danger of the former place of worship. This may pretty
fully account for the superior riches and splendour of Bhadrināth.
The town and temple of Bhadrināth are situate on the
west bank of the Alacknunda, in the centre of a valley; the
town is built on the sloping bank of the river, and contains only
twenty or thirty huts, for the accommodation of the Brahmāns
and other attendants on the deity: the æra of its foundation is
too remote to have reached us even by tradition.</p>

<p>A hot spring, issuing from the mountain by a subterraneous
passage, supplies the Tapta-Kund; it has a sulphureous smell:
Surya-Kund is another hot spring issuing from the bank. The
principal idol, Bhadrināth, is placed in artificial obscurity in the
temple, and is dressed in gold and silver brocade; above his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
head is a small looking-glass, and two or three glimmering
lamps burn before him, exhibiting the image in a dubious light.
This temple has more beneficed lands attached to it than any
other sacred Hindū establishment in this part of India. A large
number of servants of every description are kept, and during
the months of pilgrimage the deity is well-clothed, and fares
sumptuously every day; but as soon as winter commences, the
priests take their departure, leaving him to provide for his own
wants until the periodical return of the holy season. The
treasures and valuable utensils are buried in a vault under the
temple.</p>

<p>The pilgrims assemble at Hurdwar, and as soon as the fair is
concluded they visit Bhadrināth, often to the amount of forty-five
to fifty thousand, the greater part of whom are fakīrs.</p>

<h3>KEDARNĀTH.</h3>

<p>The next remarkable peak is that of Kedarnāth, 23,062 feet
above the sea; and the supposed source of the Ganges is placed
below it at the elevation of 13,800 feet.</p>

<p>The temple of Kedar-Nāth is situated at the source of the
Kalī-Gunga; it is of indefinite antiquity, not lofty, but of some
extent, and sacred to Mahadēo, or Shiva, under the name of
Kedar. There are several dhrum-salas erected for the accommodation
of the pilgrims who resort to the shrine, and who are
pretty numerous every year. There are many kunds or springs
near it.</p>

<p>The Moira peak is 22,792 feet above the sea.</p>

<h3>GANGOUTRĪ</h3>

<p>Gangoutrī (Ganga avatari) marked 10,319 feet above the sea,
is the celebrated place of pilgrimage, near to which the river
Ganges issues; its course has not been traced beyond Gangoutrī,
for the stream, a little farther, is entirely concealed under a
glacier or iceberg, and is supposed to be inaccessible. The small
mandap here is of stone, and contains small statues of Bhagiratha,
Ganga, and other local deities: it stands on a piece of
rock, about twenty feet higher than the bed of the Ganges, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
at a little distance there is a rough wooden building to shelter
travellers. Notwithstanding the great efficacy attributed to this
pilgrimage, Gangoutrī is but little frequented. The accomplishment
of it is supposed to redeem the performer from many
troubles in this world, and ensure a happy transit through all
the stages of transmigration he may have to undergo. A trifle
is paid to the Brahmān for the privilege of taking the water,
which the Hindūs believe is so pure, as neither to evaporate or
become corrupted by being kept and transported to distant
places. The Ganges enters the plains at Hurdwar, flows on to
Prāg, where it is joined by the Jumna; and, after receiving
various rivers in its course, it passes through that labyrinth of
creeks and rivers called the Sunderbands into the sea.</p>

<p>Captain J. A. Hodgson thus describes Gangoutrī:—</p>

<p>“A most wonderful scene: the B’hàgirat’hí or Ganges issues
from under a very low arch at the foot of the grand snow-bed.
The river is here bounded to the right and left by high snow and
rocks; but in front, over the <i>Debouche</i>, the mass of snow is
perfectly perpendicular; and from the bed of the stream to the
summit we estimate the thickness at little less than three hundred
feet of solid frozen snow, probably the accumulation of ages;
it is in layers of some feet thick, each seemingly the remains of
a fall of a separate year. From the brow of this curious wall
of snow, and immediately above the outlet of the stream, large
and hoary icicles depend; they are formed by the freezing of the
melted snow-water of the top of the bed, for in the middle of
the day the sun is powerful, and the water produced by its
action falls over this place in cascade, but is frozen at night.
The Gangoutrī Brahmin who came with us, and who is only an
illiterate mountaineer, observed, that he thought these icicles
must be Mahádéva’s hair, whence, as he understood it is
written in the <i>sha’stra</i>, the Ganges flows. I cannot think of any
place to which they might more aptly give the name of Cow’s
Mouth than this extraordinary <i>Debouche</i>.</p>

<p>“We were surrounded by gigantic peaks, entirely cased in
snow, and almost beyond the regions of animal and vegetable
life; and an awful silence prevailed, except when broken by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
thundering peals of falling avalanches. Nothing met our eyes
resembling the scenery in the haunts of men; by moonlight all
appeared cold, wild, and stupendous, and a Pagan might aptly
imagine the place a fit abode for demons. We did not even see
bears, or musk deer, or eagles, or any living creature, except
small birds. The dazzling brilliancy of the snow was rendered
more striking by its contrast with the dark blue colour of the
sky, which is caused by the thinness of the air; and at night
the stars shone with a lustre which they have not in a denser
atmosphere.” “It falls to the lot of few to contemplate so
magnificent an object as a snow-clad peak rising to the height of
upwards of a mile and a half, at the horizontal distance of only
two and a half miles.”</p>

<p>“She is called Ganga on account of her flowing through
Gang, the earth: she is called Jahnavi, from a choleric Hindū
saint: she is called Bhagirathi, from the royal devotee Bhagiratha,
who, by the intensity and austerity of his devotions,
brought her from heaven to earth, whence she proceeded to the
infernal regions, to reanimate the ashes of his ancestors: and
lastly, she is called Triputhaga, on account of her proceeding
forward in three different directions, watering the three worlds—heaven,
earth, and the infernal regions,—and filling the ocean,
which, according to the Brahmanical mythology, although excavated
before her appearance, was destitute of water.”</p>

<p>Hurdwar, at which place the Ganges issues on the plains, is
put down on the map.</p>

<p>The impracticable deserts of snow and rocks in these lofty
regions alone prevent the pilgrim from going directly from one
place to another. Thus, eleven days’ journey are spun out
from Gangoutrī to Kedarnāth; while seven or eight days are
expended in reaching Bhadrināth from the latter place.</p>

<p>On the map a beautiful range of mountains now appear,
crowned with the Jaunti Peak, 21,940 feet; next is Sir Kanta,
and then the pass of Bamsera.</p>

<h3>JUMNOTRĪ.</h3>

<p>Bandarponch is 23,916 feet above the sea, and the Peaks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
Jumnotrī, 20,120. Jumnotrī itself, the source of the Jumna, is
marked below in the map at the elevation of 10,849 feet.</p>

<p>At Jumnotrī the snow, which covers and conceals the
stream, is about sixty yards wide, and is bounded to the right
and left by mural precipices of granite; it is forty feet five and
a half inches thick, and has fallen from the precipices above.
In front, at the distance of about five hundred yards, part of
the base of the Jumnotrī mountain rises abruptly, cased in snow
and ice, and shutting up and totally terminating the head of
this defile, in which the Jumna originates. Captain Hodgson
says, “I was able to measure the thickness of the bed of snow
over the stream very exactly, by means of a plumb-line let
down through one of the holes in it, which are caused by the
steam of a great number of boiling springs which are at the
border of the Jumna.” The range of springs, which are extensive,
are in the dark recesses, and in the snow caverns. The
following is related concerning the origin of these hot springs:—“The
spirits of the <i>Rikhs</i>, or twelve holy men, who followed
Mahadēo from Lunka to the Himalaya (after the usurpation of
the tyrant Rawan), inhabit this rock, and continually worship
him. Here the people bathe, the Brahmān says prayers, receives
his dues, and marks the pilgrims with the sacred mud of the
hot springs. The people, out of respect, put off their shoes long
before they reach Jangotrī, and at this place there is no shelter
for them during the night. Jumna prefers simple worship at
the foot of her own and natural shrine, and has forbidden the
erection of temples to her honour.”</p>

<p>Noble rocks of varied hues and forms, crowned with luxuriantly
dark foliage, and the stream foaming from rock to rock,
form a foreground worthy of Jumnotrī. When Mahadēo retired
from Lunka, disgusted with the rebellion of his son Rawan, the
tyrant and usurper of Lunka, he formed <i>Kylās</i>, or the Himalaya
range, for his retreat; and Soomeroo Purbat, or Roodroo
Himālā, with its five peaks, rugged and inaccessible as it is, for
his own dwelling. The Bhagiruttee and Alacknunda are there
said to have sprung from the head of Mahadēo. Twelve holy
Brahmāns, denominated the twelve Rikhs, left Lunka in search<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
of Mahadēo, and penetrated to Bhyramghattee, where the J’hannevie
meets the Bhagiruttee, but could not find him. Eleven of
them, in despair, went to Cashmire, but the twelfth, named Jum-Rekhī,
remained at Bhyramghattee, sitting on a huge rock in
the course of the stream Bhagiruttee, which, instead of flowing
on as usual, was absorbed in the body of the saint and lost,
while the J’hannevie flowed on. The goddess of the stream (Bhagiruttee)
herself was at Gungotrī, worshipping Mahadēo, and
making her prostrations on the stone on which the present
temple is founded. When she felt the course of the stream was
stopped, she went in wrath to Bhyramghattee, clave Jum-Rekhī
in two, and gave a free passage to the river. One-half of the
Rekhī she flung to the westward, and it became the mountain
Bandarponch: from his thigh sprang the Jumna, and from
his skull arose the hot springs of Jumnotrī. They still show
the large rock which the Rikh sat upon, and which was divided
in two by the same fatal cut. It is a very large block of granite,
which appears to have fallen from the cliff, above the point of
union of the two rivers, and is curiously split in two.</p>

<p>The name of Bandarponch applies properly only to the
highest peaks of this mountain. Jumnotrī has reference to
the sacred spot, where worship is paid to the goddess and ablution
performed.</p>

<p>Frazer, speaking of a glen about three days’ journey from
Jumnotrī, says, “Having reached the top of the ascent, we
looked down upon a very dark and deep glen, called Palia Gadh,
which is the outlet to the waters of one of the most terrific and
gloomy valleys I have ever seen. It would not be easy to
convey by any description a just idea of the peculiarly rugged
and gloomy wildness of this glen: it looks like the ruins of
nature, and appears, as it is said to be, completely impracticable
and impenetrable. Little is to be seen except dark rocks, wood
only fringes the lower parts and the water’s edge: perhaps the
spots and streaks of snow, contrasting with the general blackness
of the scene, heighten the appearance of desolation. No
living thing is seen; no motion but that of the waters; no
sound but their roar. Such a spot is suited to engender superstition;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
and here it is accordingly found in full growth. Many
wild traditions are preserved, and many extravagant stories
related of it. On one of these ravines there are places of
worship, not built by men, but natural piles of stones, which
have the appearance of small temples. These are said to be the
residence of the <i>dewtas</i>, or spirits, who here haunt and inveigle
human beings away to their wild abodes. It is said that they
have a particular predilection for beauty in both sexes, and
remorselessly seize on any whom imprudence or accident may
have placed within their power, and whose spirits become like
theirs, after they are deprived of their corporeal frame. Many
instances were given of these ravishments: on one occasion a
young man, who had wandered near their haunts, being carried
in a trance to the valley, heard the voice of his own father, who
some years before had been thus spirited away, and who now
recognized his son. It appears that paternal affection was
stronger than the spell that bound him, and instead of rejoicing
in the acquisition of a new prey, he recollected the forlorn state
of his family deprived of their only support: he begged and
obtained the freedom of his son, who was dismissed under the
injunction of strict silence and secrecy. He, however, forgot
his vow, and was immediately deprived of speech; and, as a
self-punishment, he cut out his tongue with his own hand. This
man was said to be yet living, and I desired that he should be
brought to me; but he never came, and they afterwards informed
me that he had very lately died. More than one person
is said to have approached the spot, or the precincts of these
spirits, and those who have returned, have generally agreed in
the expression of their feelings, and have uttered some prophecy.
They fall, as they say, into a swoon, and between
sleeping and waking hear a conversation, or are sensible of
certain impressions, as if a conversation were passing which
generally relates to some future event. Indeed, the prophetic
faculty is one of the chiefly remarkable attributes of these
spirits, and of this place. The awe, however, which the natives
feel of this place is great and remarkable. The moment that
Bhisht and Kishen Sing came in sight of the place, they commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
prostrations, and the forms of worship, with many
prayers and much apparent fervency, to the spirits of the glen.
They assert that no man ever ascended the valley to any considerable
height; and that natural, as well as supernatural,
obstacles are too great to be overcome; that of the few who
have attempted it, none ever returned, or ever enjoyed his
reason again: and I believe that the former of these obstacles
may be nearly paramount, for a survey with the glass showed
the difficulty to be at least very great; and certainly, ascending
the hill to the top would be altogether impossible.”</p>

<p>There are said to be four peaks which form the top of Bandarponch,
and in a cavity, or hollow, contained between them tradition
places a lake or tank of very peculiar sanctity. No one
has ever seen this pool, for no one has ever attempted to ascend
any of these prodigious peaks. Bandarponch signifies “monkey’s
tail.” It is said that Hŭnoomān, after his conquest of
Lunkā, or Ceylon, in the shape of a monkey, when he had set
that island on fire by means of a quantity of combustible matter
tied to his tail, being afraid of the flame reaching himself, was
about to dip it in the sea (sumunder) to extinguish it; but the
sea remonstrated with him, on account of the probable consequence
to the inhabitants of its waters: whereupon Hŭnoomān
plunged his burning tail into this lake, which has ever since
retained the name. The Zemindars aver, that every year, in the
month P’hagun, a single monkey comes from the plains, by way
of Hurdwar, and ascends the highest peak of this mountain,
where he remains twelve months, and returns to give room to
another; but his entertainment must be very indifferent and
inhospitable, as may be inferred from the nature of the place;
for he returns in very bad plight, being not only reduced to a
skeleton, but having lost his hair and a great part of his skin.</p>

<p><i>Nalāpanī</i> and the level of the Dehra Dūn are marked in the
map below the source of the Jumna.</p>

<p>The Cone is a most remarkable peak; the elevation of
Parkyal and Kaldung is conspicuous among the lower mountains
over which they tower. The Nulgoon Pass is marked below
them in the map.</p>

<p>“Height of the Himalayas.—The Great Trigonometrical
Survey has determined the elevations of the great peaks of the
Himalaya range. The highest (supposed to be the highest spot
on the surface of the globe) is Kunchinginga, West Peak,
28,176 feet; the East Peak is 27,825 feet. The following are
the elevations of other peaks:—Junnoo, 25,311; Kabroo,
24,004; Chumalari (in Tibet), 23,929.”</p>

<p>“At a meeting of the Asiatic Society on the 6th November,
a paper by Col. Waugh, surveyor-general, was read, giving the
result of that officer’s operations to determine the height of
several Himalayan peaks in the neighbourhood of Darjeeling.
Col. Waugh appears to have satisfactorily ascertained that the
western peak of Cutchinchinga was 28,176 feet high, and the
eastern 27,825—thus claiming for that mountain the greatest
altitude on the earth yet known. 1848.”</p>

<p><i>1838, Sept. 8th.</i>—I made arrangements with my relative to
march across the mountains to Simla, a journey of fifteen days
from Landowr, and was looking forward with delight to all the
adventures we should meet with, and the crossing the river in a
basket suspended on a rope fastened across the stream; but he,
an old mountaineer, would not permit me to begin the journey
until the khuds—which are unwholesome during the rains, and
full of fever—should be fit to pass through. A friend had
given me the use of a house for some months beyond Simla,
and I was anxious to visit that part of the country. In the
interval we formed a party to see the mountains at the back of
Landowr, and I sent out my hill tents to the interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>In the evening I was riding alone at Mussoorī, when I met
Captain L⸺; there was an embarrassment and distress in his
manner that surprised me: he quitted his party, and led my
pony away from the walk, where the people were in crowds, and
when we were alone informed me of the death of my beloved
father. I had received no letters from home: this melancholy
event had been known some days at Mussoorī, but no one had
had the courage to tell his child. With what pain I reflected
on having so long postponed my return home! Letters from
Allahabad confirmed the melancholy news, and my kind husband
urged my return to England instantly, to see my remaining and
widowed parent.</p>

<p>I recalled my tents and people from the interior; and from
that moment the thoughts of home, and of what time it would
take from the Himalaya to Devonshire, alone filled my thoughts.
It was decided I should sail from Calcutta the next cold season.</p>

<p>The weather had become most beautiful; the rains had passed
away, and the most bracing air was over the Hills. I spent my
time chiefly in solitude, roaming in the Hills at the back of
Landowr; and where is the grief that is not soothed and tranquillized
by the enjoyment of such scenery? The rains had
passed away, and had left the air clear and transparent; the
beauty of the Snowy Ranges, whose majestic heads at intervals
flushed brightly with the rose-tints that summer twilight leaves
upon their lofty brows,—or rising with their snowy peaks of
glittering whiteness high above the clouds, was far greater than
I ever beheld before the departure of the rains.</p>

<p>Look at the outline of the highest range of the Himalaya, and
picture to yourself its grandeur and its beauty, which are not to
be fully enjoyed in the society of others, in the midst of the
gaiety of a party. Seek the highest point of the lone mountains,
and the shade of the deep forests, whose beautiful foliage is varied
by majestic pines, ever-green oaks, and brilliant rhododendrons.
In solitude gaze on the magnificence of such a scene:</p>

<p class="noindent">“Commune with thine own heart, and be still.” Let none be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
near to break the reverie: look on those mountains of eternal
snow,—the rose-tints linger on them, the white clouds roll
below, and their peaks are sharply set upon a sky of the
brightest, clearest, and deepest blue. The rushing wing of the
black eagle—that “winged and cloud-cleaving minister, whose
happy flight is highest into heaven,”—may be heard above.
The golden eagle may be seen below, poised on his wing of
might, or swooping over a precipice, while his keen eye pierces
downward, seeking his prey, into the depths of the narrow
valley between the mountains. The sweet notes of the Hill
birds are around you; and the gay butterflies, enamoured of the
wild flowers, hover over their blossoms.</p>

quietude, that wraps these forest scenes? Who may tell how
beautiful they are? Who that loves solitude does not enjoy the</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—Anxious to attain a stock of health, to enable me to
bear my homeward journey, I commenced early rising, and was
daily on my gūnth at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; it was very cold in the early
morning, so much so that I often preferred walking. Captain
Sturt, who is an excellent draughtsman, promised me a sketch
of the Hills ere my departure; this pleased me greatly, as,
perhaps, there is no country of which it is more difficult to give
a correct idea than that around Landowr. Two fine eagles were
brought to me, a golden and a black one; these I added to my
collection,—rather large birds to carry, but I shall have so much
luggage, it matters but little, a few chests more or less; every
thing belonging to the mountains is so interesting. These
birds are continually seen, especially at the back of Landowr.
A pair of the Loonjee, the red, or Argus pheasants of the Himalaya,
have been given me: the bird has a black top-knot, and
the neck below has a most peculiar skin over it; beyond which
are crimson feathers, bright as gold; the breast is covered with
feathers, half red, half black, and in the centre of the black,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
which is at the end of the feather, is a white eye. The feathers
on the back are of a <i>game</i> brown, tipped with black, in which is
also the white spot: these birds are very rare and very valuable.
I also received a fine hawk, and some small birds of brilliant
feather: also the heads and horns of four <i>gooral</i>, the small wild
deer of the Hills.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—First met Colonel Arnold, of the 16th Lancers; we
talked of the old regiment. Nothing pleases me so much as
the kindness and affection with which my relatives, who were in
this gallant corps, are spoken of by the old 16th.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Not having forgotten the Hill woman I saw on our
return from the waterfall, I rode alone to Būttah, hoping to
catch sight of her, but was disappointed: <i>en route</i>, my dog
Sancho put up a nide of Kallinge pheasants; they rose with a
<i>phurr</i>,—as the natives call the noise of a bird,—as of a partridge
or quail suddenly taking wing.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Colonel Everest has a fine estate near Bhadráj, called
“The Park;” I rode over with a most agreeable party to breakfast
there this morning, and to arrange respecting some boundaries,
which, after all, we left as unsettled as ever; it put me in mind
of the child’s play:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Here stands a post.’—‘Who put it there?’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘A better man than you, touch it if you dare.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Boundaries in the Hills are determined, not by landmarks,
but by the fall of the rain; in the division of a mountain, all that
land is yours down which the rain water runs on your side, and
on the opposite side, all the land is your neighbour’s over which
the water makes its way downwards.</p>

<p>Colonel Everest is making a road—a most scientific affair;
the obstacles to be conquered are great,—levelling rocks,
and filling up khuds. The Park is the finest estate in the
Hills.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—I was fortunate in being able to procure camels, and
sent off my baggage from Rajpūr in time to allow the animals
to return to Meerut to be in readiness to march with the army
there collecting for Afghānistan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—A sā’īs cooking his dinner by accident set fire to my
stables, in which were five gūnths: the privates of the Lancers
and Buffs, whose barracks are a little higher up the Hill,
were with us in a moment; they saved the ponies, but
the stable, which was formed of bamboo, mats, and straw,
was reduced to ashes. A few days afterwards our house
was set on fire; the men, who were always on the alert, put it
out immediately.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Having ascertained that the water in the Keeree Pass
had subsided, and that it had been open for three days, we
determined to quit Landowr for Meerut: accordingly a dāk and
horses having been laid for us, our party went down this morning
to Rajpūr. It was a beautiful ride, but when we reached the
foot of the Hill the heat became most unpleasant: such a sudden
change from fires and cold breezes, to the hot winds—for such
it felt to us at Rajpūr—when we took refuge at Mrs. Theodore’s
hotel. She has stuffed birds for sale; her Moonāl pheasants
are very dear, sixteen rupees a pair; but they are not reckoned
as well prepared as those of Mr. Morrow, the steward at the
hospital. Our party being too large to proceed dāk in a body,
it was agreed I should lead the way, with Captain L⸺ as my
escort. At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we got into our palanquins, and commenced
the journey: crossing the Deyra Dhoon it was hot, very hot, and
the sides of the palanquin felt quite burning. As the sun sank
we entered the Keeree Pass, where I found the air very cold; and
it struck so chillily upon me that I got out of the palanquin,
intending to walk some distance. The Pass is the dry bed of a
mountain torrent, passing through high cliffs, covered with fine
trees and climbers; a stream here and there crosses the road.
During a part of the year it is impassable, but the water having
subsided, the road had been open three days.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful night, and a beautiful scene; I enjoyed it
extremely, and walked some distance, aided by my long paharī
pole. Wishing my escort to partake in the pleasure to be
derived from such romantic and picturesque scenery, I asked
him if he would walk. He partially opened the doors of his
palanquin, and looking out, expressed his astonishment at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
madness of my walking in the Pass; said the malaria was so
great he had shut the doors of the palkī, and lighted a cigar to
secure himself from its influence, begged I would get into my
palanquin, and keep the doors closed as long as I was in the
Pass. I followed his advice, but the moonlight night often
tempted me to open the doors, and I became completely ill at
times from the chill that fell upon my chest, like the deadly chill
of a vault, in spite of having wrapped myself up in a blanket.
At first I was unwilling to attribute it to the effect of the air of
the Keeree Pass, but having arrived at the end of it, these
uncomfortable feelings instantly disappeared.</p>

<p>An instance of the danger of the Pass is, that Mrs. T⸺
was detained for two hours at the entrance of it, for want of
bearers,—she took a fever and died. The wife of the behishti,
who was with our servants, was detained at the same place,—she
took the fever, and it killed her. To sleep in the Pass one night
is to run the pretty certain chance of fever, perhaps death:
there is something in the air that almost compels one to sleep.
With the very greatest difficulty I kept my eyes open, even when
in pain from a chilly sickness that had crept over me: I thought
of Corinne and the Pontine Marshes, in passing which she could
scarcely resist the spell that induced her to long for sleep, even
when she knew that sleep would be the sleep of death. Quitting
the Pass, we entered on the plains, where the sun was burningly
hot—how fierce it was! We did not arrive at Dēobund, where we
were to take shelter, until noon the next day; I felt sick and
faint from the excessive heat, and was very glad to gain the
shelter of a roof.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> our palanquins were ready; getting into
them was like going into an oven. We had taken the precaution
of having no dinner during the heat of the day; in the cool of the
evening refreshment was welcome, in the shade of the jangal by
the road-side. The bearers were good, and at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we arrived
at the spot, to which a buggy had been sent, and horses laid on
the road: how gladly I left the hot palanquin for the cool air in
the buggy! The roads were so bad, they were absolutely dangerous,
and the moonlight so puzzling, we could not see the holes
into which the buggy was continually going bump bump, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
infinite hazard of breaking the springs; nevertheless, we arrived
in safety at Meerut.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 2nd.</i>—The first thing necessary was to enjoy a good
canter in the plains after having been obliged to ride a gūnth so
many months in the Hills. On the well-watered course, of an
evening, the band of the Lancers was an attraction; they played
well, and the instruments were good. The band came out with
us in the “Marchioness of Ely,” and I recognised some faces
amongst them. Fearing to encounter the intense heat in a boat
at this season of the year, and hearing that cholera was at some
of the stations on the river, I determined to prolong my stay at
Meerut.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—Accompanied Colonel Arnold and Sir Willoughby
Cotton to a review of the 16th Lancers; I was much pleased
with the review, and the fine appearance of the men.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Revisited the tomb of Jaffir Sāhib,—one I particularly
admire, because the dome is open at the top, that the dews of
heaven and the sunshine may fall upon the marble sarcophagus,
wherein repose the ashes of the saint. A tomb like this is
preferable to weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath; and
such an one, canopied by the vault of heaven alone, would the
pilgrim desire, as the lone couch of her everlasting rest. It is a
ruin, but must formerly have been a beautiful building.</p>

<p>Returning home we saw two <i>chiri-mārs</i> (bird-catchers). Their
game is snared in a novel fashion: they carry a sort of shield,
made of light split bamboo, entwined with green boughs; they
crouch to the ground, bearing this verdant shield before them,
like a stalking horse, at the same time putting through it a very
long thin bamboo, the end of which is covered with bird-lime;
with this they touch a small bird, and then carefully drawing
the bamboo back to the boughs, put a hand through the shield,
and secure the game. This style of bird-catching is simple and
ingenious; I never saw it before.</p>

<p>What vicious brutes the native horses are!—In the evening I
was riding on the course with two gentlemen: Captain A⸺’s
horse, a vicious, intemperate, great black animal, attacked mine,
and lashed out most furiously. I threw my feet on my horse’s
mane: luckily for me they were out of the way in time, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
horse’s heels cut through my habit, and would have broken my
limbs had I not been sitting monkey fashion.</p>

<p>My companions were alarmed:—“My God, he has broken
her legs!” was the first exclamation, followed by a laugh on
seeing my position, and “at least if he has not kicked your
habit, he has a habit of kicking.” The escape pleased me, and
I refused to ride again in company with so dangerous a horse.
He was a fine strong animal, and carried his gallant master nobly
through all the hardships of the ensuing Afghānistan campaign.
The country horses are horribly savage, and a frightful accident
occurred at Allahabad. Serjeant Percival, who was riding with
Serjeant Cunningham, dismounted to drink at a well, giving his
horse to a cooly to hold; the horse broke from the cooly and
attacked Serjeant Cunningham; tore his hand severely, broke
his leg in several places, pulled him off his horse, shook him as
a dog does a rat, knelt upon him, and tore him with his teeth:
at length the horse was driven off, and the serjeant was carried
to a hospital, where he died a few hours afterwards. When the
16th Lancers first arrived at Cawnpore, the privates as <i>Waterloo
men</i> considered themselves superior to the 11th Dragoons, and
when a man of the latter ventured to differ in opinion with the
former, he was cut short by “When were <i>you</i> at Waterloo?” The
enmity occasioned by this was done away with one day on parade.
A Lancer, who was riding a vicious country horse, was thrown;
the beast knelt upon the man and bit him fiercely. The Lancers
looked on with astonishment; the 11th Dragoons, accustomed to
such little accidents, had recourse to bamboos; they drove the
horse away, and as one of them picked up the mangled Lancer,
“Did you ever see the like of <i>that</i> at Waterloo?” said the
Dragoon.—Thus was harmony established between the privates
of the two regiments. The Lancers have a very good theatre:
the plays are encouraged by the officers, and the privates have
the whole management of it: the scenes, which are painted by
the men, are very well done; their acting is good, and the band
a great addition. The privates performed the “Iron Chest,”
and “The Middy Ashore:” the delight of the men, and the
enthusiastic manner in which they applauded their comrades,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
when any thing pleased them, was quite amusing. After the
play, the performers came forward, and sang “God save the
Queen.” By way of adding to the effect, on either side the
stage was placed a Lancer in full uniform, leaning on his sword,
with his lance in one hand. This was a fancy of the privates.
The two men might have stood for pictures of manly beauty;
their attitudes were excellent, the effect was good, and their
comrades were so much delighted, they gave them a round of
applause. The management of a theatre is an excellent occupation
for soldiers in a hot climate.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Crossing a nālā this morning during an excursion in
search of the picturesque, my horse got into a hole, and we
were very nearly thrown over, both together, into the stream.
I gave him his head, and let him extricate himself, waiting
patiently the result of his sagacity. He carried me out completely
soaked, and strained his hind leg in gaining the bank.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Colonel Arnold gave a farewell ball to his friends at
Meerut. The Lancers are to march for Afghānistan on the
30th. His house is built after his own fancy: from without it
has the appearance of Hindoo temples that have been added to
a bungalow; nevertheless, the effect is good. The interior is
very unique. The shape of the rooms is singular; the trellis
work of white marble between them, and the stained glass in
the windows and over the doors give it an Eastern air of beauty
and novelty. Fire-balloons were sent up, fireworks displayed;
the band was good, and the ball went off with great spirit.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—The evening after this fête, during the time Colonel
Arnold was at dinner, and in the act of taking wine with Sir
Willoughby Cotton, he burst a blood-vessel on his lungs, and
was nearly choked. Medical aid was instantly called in; he was in
extreme danger during the night, and was bled three times. A
hope of his recovery was scarcely entertained: never was more
interest or more anxiety felt by any people than by those at
Meerut for Colonel Arnold. He had just attained the object of
his ambition, the command during the war of that gallant regiment
the 16th Lancers; and he was beloved both by the officers
and the men. At 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> he parted with the guests in his ball-room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
in high health and spirits: at seven that evening he lay
exhausted and apparently dying. When at Waterloo he was
shot through the lungs, and recovered. It was one of those
remarkable instances of recovery from a severe gun-shot wound,
and as that had gone through the lungs, the breaking of the
blood-vessel was a fearful occurrence.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Colonel Arnold is still in great danger, but his friends
indulge in hopes of his recovery. Two field-officers called to
take leave of me. I asked, “What is this war about, the fear
that the Russians and Persians will drive us into the sea?”
Colonel Dennie answered, “The Government must have most
powerful reasons, of which we are ignorant; it is absurd to
suppose <i>that</i> can be the reason of the war; why send <i>us</i> there?
let them fag themselves out by coming to us; we shall get there
easily enough, but how shall we return? We may be cut up
to a man.” His companion agreed with him, and this was the
general opinion of the military men of my acquaintance. The
old 16th marched from Meerut on the 30th October. Never
was there a finer body of men under the sun. Their route is
marked out across a desert, where all the water they will get for
man or beast for three days they must carry with them in
skins. <i>Why</i> they have been ordered on such a route the secret
and political department alone can tell—the men ask if it be to
take <i>the shine out of them</i>: there is another road, said to be good,
therefore it is difficult to understand the motive of taking them
across the desert to Shikarpore.</p>

<p>My boats being ready at Ghurmuktesur Ghāt, I started dāk
to join them; on my arrival a fine breeze was blowing, a number
of vessels of every description were at anchor; the scene was
picturesque, and my people were all ready and willing to start.
Messrs. Gibson and Co. of Meerut have furnished me with two large
flat-bottomed country boats, on each of which a house is built of
bamboo and mats, which is well thatched; the interior of the
one in which I live is divided into two large rooms, and has two
bathing-rooms; the floor is of planks, covered with a gaily-coloured
<i>sutrāengī</i>, a cotton carpet; and the inside is fitted up
with white cloth—sometimes the rooms are fitted up with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
coloured chintz used for tents. The other large boat contains
the servants, the horses, and the dogs. The sort of boat generally
used for this purpose is called a surrī, which is a patelī
that draws very little water, and is generally rowed from the
top of the platform above the roof, on which the dāndīs live.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Started from Ghurmuktesur Ghāt the moment it
became possible to see the way down the river, and to avoid the
sandbanks. At 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the thermometer was 82°,—a most oppressive
heat for one just arrived from the Hills. Lugāoed on
a sandbank, and walked with the dogs until ten at night, when I
went to rest and dreamed of thieves, because this part of the
Ganges is dangerous, and I have no guard on board the boats.
From a fisherman on the bank I have purchased fish enough
for myself and all the crew, a feast for us all, and a piece of good
luck.</p>

<p>Taking a walk with the dogs puts me in mind of the kennel
I had in the Hills, and of Khobarah, the magnificent dog of the
Himalaya, of whom his former master told me this anecdote:—“Sitting
one night in my tent, the dog at my feet, a bearer, in
a state of intoxication, entered and spoke to me; the voice of
the drunken man was loud and angry: the dog seized him
instantly by the throat, bore him to the ground, and held him
there. He did not injure the man: it being night, I suppose
the creature thought me menaced with danger. He quitted him
the instant I bade him do so.”</p>

<p>I gave this dog on quitting the Hills to a relative, desiring
him to chain him up until he had made his acquaintance and
ensured his friendship. My relative came to me a week afterwards
highly amused, and said,—“The moment your dog was
unchained he took possession of the verandah of my house.
He is walking up and down lashing himself into fury; he keeps
us all at bay, and I cannot enter the house; perhaps when he sees
you he will become more composed, and allow me to go in to
breakfast.”</p>

<p>In 1844, Khobarah, the Hill dog, was still in prime health,
taking care of the cows at night at Cloud End, near Landowr.
The fate of my dog Sancho was pitiable: he was in the Hills<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
with a small spaniel I had given my relative,—a sharp cry from
the dog brought the gentleman to the door; a short distance
from the house he saw the spaniel in the mouth of a leopard,
who carried him down the khud. Sancho was on the ground,
having had his side cut open by a blow from the paw of the
wild beast; the poor dog crawled to the feet of my friend, he
took him up, and tried in vain to save his life—poor Sancho
died.</p>

<p>A fine litter of spaniel pups once placed me in a dilemma: a
friend thus settled the point. “It is as much a duty to cut a
dog’s tail according to his caste, as it is to have drawn the
superfluous teeth of a young Christian. This answer to the
question respecting the tails of the young pups must be sent at
once, lest time and the habit of wearing a whole tail should
attach them, the pups, too strongly to the final three-quarters of
an inch, which I think they should lose: the object with a
spaniel is not so much to reduce the length as to obviate the
thin and fish-hooky appearance of the natural tail. There is no
cause to mourn such severe kindness to these pups; grieve not
for them! theirs is an age when pain passes with the moment of
infliction, and if, as some crying philosopher has observed, ‘We
know no pleasure equal to a sudden relief from pain,’ the cutting
and firing will be all for the good of the little dogs.” The price
of a gūnth is from sixty to a hundred rupees: a good Almorah
gūnth will fetch a hundred and sixty, or a fancy price of three
hundred rupees. The common gūnths are used for fetching
water from the khuds, but such is the dangerous nature of
the mountain paths they descend, they are often killed by a fall
over a precipice. The only animals fit for such work are mules,
which may be bought at the Hurdwar fair, at a reasonable price.
The beautiful gūnth Motī, whom I have before mentioned, was
sent on an emergency to bring water from the khud: he fell
over in returning with the heavy water bags and was <i>smashed</i> in
the khud below—smashed! that is not <i>my</i> word, but picked up
in intercourse with men, and is as shocking as a phrase I once
made use of, “<i>knocked over</i> by a buffalo!”</p>

<p>This is too technical and gentlemanlike an expression; in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
such cases one should sacrifice brevity in favour of the “I hope
you may obtain it style,” (<i>i.e.</i> the feminine of “I wish you
may get it,”) and say, you will be thrown down or hurt by a
buffalo’s running against you. The rules of female education,
both of the governess and of after life, prevent a lady’s knowing
whether such an out-of-door animal as a buffalo attacks people
with his head or tail, and a lady should betray no nearer
acquaintance with the horrible creature than that implied in the
form of speech above appointed for adoption. Our language
affords a table-land of communication between lady and gentleman,
where the technical difficulties on either side the hill are
out of sight. If the lady is to speak of a fashion she will leave
out scientific terms, as will the gentleman if he is talking of a
race; and I see no objection to the language of the man and
woman being exactly similar. Any affectation, such as extreme
delicacy and timidity, is vulgar, and suited to novel-reading ladies’
maids and milliners’ apprentices. Every term or word turned
from its common and general meaning to a particular meaning,
is what I consider technical. Such are not only words employed
in any art or science in a sense differing from their common
acceptation, but, also, such words used in an uncommon sense
by a particular set of people, schoolboys, or fashionables. To
“cut over with a stone” is a school expression, which of course
cannot be referred to the general meaning of the words. Any
thing being in good or bad taste is a technicality of good society.
Some expressions of this nature, when original, are rather to be
considered as <i>bon-mots</i>. Such as Sydney Smith’s saying that a
clergyman next him at dinner had a ten-parson power of boring.
To make use of French words, unless cleverly selected, comes
under my ban, but the practice of good society is against me, I
believe, in this. A schoolboy’s word like that of “being
knocked over,” can be used with very good effect in fun. A
lady may talk to a man of having a lark, or use any such word,—but
it must not be used as her own word, but as if she were to
say, “as you would call it.” I will give the rest of this essay
another time, for fear of <i>knocking over</i> the patience of the dear
ones around the hearth of my childhood’s home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—A fine breeze—the horse boat has just passed alongside—one
of the horses looked out of the window and neighed
loudly. I like to hear a horse neigh: poor boy, he would
sooner be galloping with me on his back over the green sward
of the race-course, than be cabined, cribbed, confined, in the
boat; nevertheless, both the horses eat, drink, and lie down
to sleep like old soldiers.</p>

<p>Another burning day. How good my health must be to
stand such heat without much inconvenience! The constant
confinement to a boat is very irksome and disagreeable; and
this life of quietude after so much exercise is enough to make
me ill. Would that I were once more enjoying the morning
breeze, cantering against it! The early breeze on the river is
damp and unwholesome, therefore I remain idly on my charpāī
until half-past 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> The banks are low and ugly, the river
broad and shallow, and full of great sandbanks, between which
we glide.</p>

<p>There is little on this part of the river to afford amusement;
here and there a flock of wild birds rises from the sands, and
alligators basking in the sun have the appearance of logs of
wood.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—To-day we have reached the district in charge of
Mr. H⸺ S⸺, and the head man of the village off which
we have moored, has come on board to offer his services in procuring
watchmen for the night, food for the horses, &amp;c. All
the way down we have lugāoed on sandbanks in wild out-of-the-way
spots: how pleasant it is to have quitted the jangal! In
this district I feel at home, and chaukidars have come to guard
the boats.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Arrived at Fathīgarh, and drove to the house of my
relative; the grounds were just as beautiful, as full of flowers
and flowering trees, and just as fresh as ever; the house cool
and pleasant. On my return to my boat in the evening, I
found the heat excessive, which, added to the bites of the
musquitoes, kept me awake until 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, at which time the
washermen came down to the river-side and made a great noise;
their method of washing is to dip a garment into the water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
then to lay it on a piece of flat board and soap it, after which
they whirl the garment above their heads, and down it comes
on the flat board with a loud sound, to which is added a most
peculiar noise, like a <i>pavior’s grunt</i>, given by the dhobīs, when
the garment strikes the board, as if the exertion exhausted them;
this whirling and beating is continued for a short time, when the
clothes are taken to the man’s house, put over a most simple
steam apparatus, which completely cleans them, after which
they are rinsed, dryed, and ironed.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Quitted the Fort Ghāt; after a good run of forty
miles anchored at Kanauj, where the people cooked and ate
their dinners; after which we cast the boats off into the middle
of the stream, allowing them to float down just at the pleasure
of the current, whilst the people slept; but their slumbers were
occasionally disturbed by the boat running aground on a sandbank
or on shore, when they were roused up to get her off
again.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Reached Bitoor at breakfast time; a large fair was
being held on the banks of the river. Here we nearly lost the
horse-boat; a strong wind carried the boats against a high bank,
which was falling in every second; just as the horse-boat ran
foul of it the bank fell in; the chaprasī on deck cut the towing-line
with his sword, and the boat swerved off from the bank;
she was filled with earth, and all but swamped. The horses,
feeling the violent rocking of the vessel, neighed loudly several
times, as if conscious of danger, and willing to remind us of
their existence. The boat righted, and was got off with some
difficulty.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Cawnpore we were detained by the bridge
of boats, which was closed, and would not be opened until noon
the next day.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 1st.</i>—Rose early, and went on shore to buy two toon-wood
trees, and one of sāl. It is nearly noon; I wish the
bridge of boats would open, and let us pass through; waiting on
this hot sandbank is very tiresome, and the wind is favourable.
I have had much plague with the mānjhī of the horse-boat;
<i>n’importe</i>,—a lonely pilgrim must expect a little annoyance on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
road at times. At noon the bridge opened, and we passed through;
anchored on the other side, to get the timber trees off the bank
into the river. The sāl tree, very heavy wood, twenty-two cubits
in length, and two feet six inches in diameter, was lying on a
high pile of trees; with the greatest difficulty it was moved, it was
so wedged in amongst the rest; about twenty men were in the
river below the tree, pulling at a rope fixed to a beam as a lever;
all of a sudden the tree got loose, and down it thundered, rolling
over on its side into the river below. I am not a coward, but
when I saw what appeared inevitable death to five or six of my
own men, I covered my eyes with my hands, expecting to see them
crushed to death, and lying under the tree in the water; however,
the cry of “By the blessing of God and the mem Sāhiba’s
good luck they have escaped,” was indeed welcome: they had
all sprung aside quick as lightning, and not a man was hurt. We
then proceeded down the river, taking our sāl tree, lashed to the
side of my boat, which made her all on one side; therefore I
purchased two toon-wood trees at another timber-yard, and lashed
them on the other side, which righted the boat, the toon
being lighter wood than the sāl: by the time this was over it
was 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I paid the men well who had worked so hard, and
gave the crews of both boats sweetmeats enough to last for four
days; all were in good humour, and I sought my couch completely
fagged. But sleep was driven away by the musquitoes;
I killed hundreds of the vile tormentors. Every night we drift
down with the stream after the people have had their food on
shore.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—On the top of the thatch of the house which is built on
my boat, is a platform on which the people sit; when the wind
is in a particular direction all that is said above is plainly heard
in the cabin below. A most theological discourse has amused me
for the last hour carried on between my khidmatgār, one of the
Faithful, and a staunch Hindū, one of my chaprasīs. The
question under consideration was, whether God made Hindūs or
Musalmāns first; and whether you ought to say “By the
blessing of Allah,” or “By the blessing of Vishnŭ.” These
points the Musalmān undertook to explain. The questions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
the Hindū were simple, but most puzzling; nor could the man
refrain from a laugh now and then, when some curious point of
faith was explained to him by the follower of the prophet. It
ended by the khidmatgār saying, “If you do not believe in
Allah and the kurān, they will take you by that Hindū top-knot
of yours, hold you by it whilst they fill your mouth with fire,
and pitch you to <i>Jahannam</i>.” I laughed,—the people heard
me, and being aware that their conversation was overheard,
dropped the subject. The follower of Muhammad worked so
hard and so earnestly to gain a convert, it was unfortunate his
opponent should have been so utterly incapable of understanding
what he considered the true faith.</p>

<p>The Musalmāns are anxious for converts; the Hindūs will
neither make proselytes, nor be converted themselves. Deism
is the religion of well-educated Hindūs, they leave idolatry to
the lower orders. When conversing with a lady one evening,
the priest’s bell was heard; she said, “I must attend,—will you
come with me?” Accordingly we entered the small room
which contained the idols; they were lighted up, and the
Brahmāns in attendance. The worship proceeded: I said to the
lady, “Is it possible that <i>you</i> can believe in the power of brazen
images, the work of men’s hands?” She answered, “I believe in
one great and eternal God; as for these images, it is the custom
of the country to worship them; the lower orders believe in
their power.” “Why do you attend such pooja?” said I. She
looked at the Brahmāns as if she feared our conversation might
be overheard, and answered, “Their power is great; if I were
not to appear it would soon be over; they⸺” she ceased
speaking, and drew her forefinger across her throat with a
significant gesture. The conversation dropped; and I observed
the Brahmāns “cast camel’s glances<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>” both on her and me.</p>

<p>The clergyman at Allahabad converted a Hindū to the
Christian faith; consequently, the man became an outcast,—he
could neither eat, drink, nor smoke with his own family; he
complained to the clergyman, and was taken into service. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
attendance at church was constant. His patron died: the man
was never seen afterwards at Divine Service. The newly
appointed clergyman inquired the reason, and this answer was
returned:—“I received eight rupees a month from your predecessor;
if you will give me the same I will go to church every
Sunday!”—So little did the man comprehend his adopted
religion, or the kindness that induced the Clergyman to support
him!</p>

<p>Passed Manucpūr with a fine breeze and a powerful stream in
our favour; lugāoed below Kurrah, where the people cooked on
shore, and as soon as the moon was high we turned the boat
into the current, and allowed her to drift; the helmsman ties
the rudder up in the centre, and usually lies down to sleep by
its side; if the vessel run ashore, he starts up, and marvels at
the occurrence. We drifted the whole night by moonlight; at
one time I told them to anchor, but the bank kept falling in in
so fearful a manner we were obliged to put off again.</p>

<p>Just as we came to the bank to lugāo the men suddenly
shoved the boat back into the stream, saying, “Some one has
sneezed, we cannot anchor here at present.” A few moments
afterwards they anchored. They are superstitious respecting a
sneeze, and by waiting for a short time fancy the evil influence
passes away. “After sneezing you may eat or bathe, but not
go into any one’s house<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>:” because it is considered an omen of
ill luck.</p>

<p>A fair breeze is springing up; we are near home, and they
will be looking for the return of the wanderer. We are off
Papamhow; the river is very shallow and very broad. We passed
the ghāt, and moored while the people ate their dinners. I
would have proceeded by moonlight, but was deterred from
doing so by the advice of the fishermen on the banks, who said
it would be very dangerous then to go on, as the stream was
very fierce and shallow below.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—Arrived at Raj-ghāt, at which place the carriage was
waiting for me; but I found it impossible to reach the ghāt, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
force of the current drove us off; therefore, taking the crew of
the horse-boat to aid our own, we dropped down into the Jumna
below the Fort; in doing this, we ran against another vessel,
and did our own some damage. At this moment we are making
our way slowly and with difficulty up the stream against the
current of the Jumna, just below the Fort; the view is interesting,
and the pilgrim will reach the landing-place, below her
own old peepul-tree, within an hour. I have at this moment
but little energy left wherewith to pursue my homeward voyage,
but my promise is yours, my beloved mother, and your child
would not disappoint you for all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind.
She who ventures on the waters must take patience, and await
the good pleasure of the wind and tides; but there is the Fort
and the great Masjid, and the old peepul-tree, and the mem
sāhiba’s home, and the <i>chabūtara</i><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> on the bank of the river,
which is crowded with friends on the look out for the pilgrim,
and ready to hail her return with the greatest pleasure.</p>

</div>

<p><i>1838, Nov.</i>—On my first arrival at Allahabad I thought I
should never get through all the arrangements necessary before
my departure for England; so many farewell visits were to be
paid to my old friends, and so many preparations were to be
made for the voyage. Her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī was still at
Allahabad, and she sent for me. One of the Italian greyhounds
given me by Captain Osborne having died, I took the other two,
and presented them to the Gaja Rājā Sāhib, the young princess
having expressed a wish to have one: I gave her also a black
terrier, and one of King Charles’s spaniels.</p>

<p>One day a Mahratta lady came to my house, riding, <i>en cavalier</i>,
on a camel, which she managed apparently with the greatest
ease; she told me her Highness requested I would call immediately
upon her. On my arrival in camp, after the ceremony
of meeting had passed, the Bāiza Bā’ī said, “You are going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
England,—will you procure for me three things? The first is,
a perfectly high caste Arabian mare; secondly, a very, very
little dog, just like a ball, covered with long hair, perfectly
white, and having red eyes; and thirdly, a mechanical figure,
that, standing on a slack rope, with a pole in its hand, balances
itself, and moves in time to the music that plays below it.”</p>

<p>I thought of the fairy tales, in which people are sent to roam
the world in search of marvellous curiosities, and found myself
as much perplexed as was ever knight of old by the commands
of a fairy. The Bā’ī added, “You know a good Arab, I can
trust your judgment in the selection; the little dogs, they say,
come from Bombay: you can bring them all with you in the
ship on your return.”</p>

<p>I informed her Highness that very few Arabs were in England;
that in her Majesty’s stud there were some, presents from Eastern
Princes, who were not likely to part with the apple of their
eyes: that I did not think an Arab mare was to be had in the
country. With respect to the little powder-puff dog with the
red eyes, I would make enquiries: and the mechanical figure
could be procured from Paris.</p>

<p>A few days after this visit one of her ladies called on me, and
the following conversation ensued:—</p>

<p><i>Mahratta Lady</i>—“You are going to England,—you will be
absent eighteen months or two years,—have you arranged all
your household affairs? You know how much interest I take in
your welfare; I hope you have made proper arrangements.”</p>

<p>I assured her I had.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, with respect to the household, that is all very well;
but with respect to your husband, what arrangement have
you made? It is the custom with us Mahrattas, if a wife
quit her husband, for her to select and depute another lady to
remain with him during her absence;—have you selected such
a one?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, with the utmost gravity; “such an arrangement
never occurred to me;—will you do me the honour to supply my
place?”</p>

<p>She laughed and shook her head. “I suppose you English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
ladies would only select one wife; a Mahratta would select two
to remain with her husband during her absence.”</p>

<p>I explained to her the opinions of the English on such
subjects: our ideas appeared as strange to her as hers were to
me; and she expressed herself grieved that I should omit what
they considered a duty.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—I called on the ex-Queen of Gwalior, and took leave
in all due form; the dear old lady was very sorry to part with
me,—the tears ran down her cheeks, and she embraced me over
and over again. I was sincerely grieved to part with her
Highness, with whom and in whose camp I had passed so many
happy hours, amused with beholding native life and customs,
and witnessing their religious ceremonies. The next day she
sent me the complimentary farewell dinner, which it is the
custom to present to a friend on departure: I partook of some
of the Mahratta dishes, in which, to suit my taste, they had
omitted musk or assafœtida; the cookery was good; pān, atr,
and rose-water, as usual, ended the ceremony.</p>

<p>Those ladies who are kind enough to support and educate the
orphan children of natives, are startled at times by curious
occurrences. A lady at this station lately married one of her
orphans to a drummer in the 72nd regiment, and gave twenty
rupees as a portion; the man was drunk for about a week; in a
fortnight he made over his wife to another drummer, and in a
month came to the lady, saying, “If you please, Ma’am, I should
like to marry again.” “Why, John Strong, you were married
a few days ago!” “Yes, Ma’am, but I made over she to my
comrade.” Imagine the lady’s amazement and horror! The
man John Strong went away, and told his officers he thought
he had been very ill-used. The man was a half-caste Christian,
the girl a converted native.</p>

<p>The famine in the north-western provinces has been occasioned
by the almost entire failure of the usual rains. Government
has done much in giving employment to those who can work,
and food and medical aid to the sick; and more than a lākh of
rupees has already been raised by private subscription on our
side of India, and they are subscribing for the same purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
very liberally in the Bombay Presidency. Allahabad luckily has
escaped, but every sort of grain is very dear, and large farm-yards
like ours are somewhat costly. During the time of the
famine the natives sold their children in order to save their
lives; and large numbers of the unfortunate Būndelās, the
natives of Būndel-khand, arrived at Allahabad, famished and
dying; subscriptions were raised, and the poor wretches were
supported by charity. A most excellent and religious lady at
the station proposed sending to the up-country, where the
famine raged the most severely, and purchasing ten young girls;
these girls she undertook to bring up in the Christian religion,
to teach them reading, writing, and needlework, and on their
attaining a suitable age, to put them into service as ayahs to
European ladies. The ladies at the station entered into her
plans, and I agreed to buy and support two girls as my share.
A calculation was then entered into as to the expense that would
be incurred; I told her, “The other day, a Būndelā woman
came to my door with twins in a basket, which she offered for
sale for <i>two rupees</i>! I was greatly surprised; the little naked
creatures sprawling in the basket were in good condition, but
their mother was a skeleton. ‘Two rupees!’ said I, ‘that is a
high price; I will give you one rupee for the twins, if you give
me the basket into the bargain.’ The poor woman, delighted
at having found a purchaser on any terms, laid her children at
my feet, and making many salāms, thanked me for having saved
them from death. I took them into the room where my
husband was sitting, and laid them on the table as a present for
him: he laughed, and gave me some money for the woman. I
returned the twins, and sent her to the place where the Būndelās
are supported by the contributions of the station.”</p>

<p>Having heard this history, my friend wrote to a clergyman up
the country, who purchased for us ten girls, all under eleven
years of age, and sent them down; the market for children was
looking up; he charged us the enormous price of ten rupees
apiece! They were placed in a comfortable house, with a school-mistress
to instruct them; every care was taken of them, and
the ladies of the station attended the school, and superintended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
their morals. It certainly flourished to a very great degree;
they studied the commandment, “increase and multiply and
replenish the earth,” with so much assiduity, that in a short time
all the little girls were in a fair way of becoming mammas;—a
circumstance perfectly inexplicable, unless they had eaten the
seeds of the peepul-tree:—a peasant girl in Hampshire declared
the same effect was produced by eating water-cresses. It was
an annoying failure, that experimental school of ours. Speaking
to an officer in the 16th Lancers, of the care that had been taken
of these girls, of the religious instruction that had been bestowed
upon them, and the disheartening finale of our charitable
labours, he said, “In that dreadful famine hordes of wretched
famished Būndelās flocked into Cawnpore, and very liberal
subscriptions were collected to feed them; great numbers,
however, perished from hunger, and mothers offered their
children for sale for one rupee each: several were bought by
very well-intentioned persons, to be educated, and converted to
Christianity. Some little time after the Būndelās had disappeared
from the station, I happened to be dining with an old
friend, who, in the evening, asked if I would accompany her in
her drive to the bungalow where these children were being
educated to form ladies’ maids, as she had a favour to ask of me,
that I would that evening stand godfather to twenty-two of
these children; I declined the honour, and some months afterwards
heard that these children would shortly require godfathers
and godmothers for their own offspring, should they bring them
up as Christians.”</p>

<p>The enormous pillar now prostrate near the entrance gate
of the Fort at Allahabad is to be set up on a pedestal, on an
ascent of steps, and surmounted by a lion <i>couchant</i>. Colonel
Edward Smith is entrusted with the performance of the work.
The natives call it Bhīm Singh kí lāt—that is, Bhīm Singh’s
walking-stick. The <i>hajjām</i> (the barber), whom I consulted on
the subject, says he was a great <i>pahalwān</i> (wrestler): further
I know not.</p>

<p>Seneca says, “It is harder to judge and examine than to take
opinions upon trust; and therefore the far greater part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
world borrow from others those which they entertain concerning
all the affairs of life and death.” In the present instance,
like the world in general, I take my opinion of the pillar upon
trust, and firmly believe in all the barber asserts; more especially,
as some of the inscriptions on the lāt are in unknown characters;
those of the mighty dead, who have disappeared from the earth,
leaving records imperishable but incomprehensible. The Bāiza
Bā’ī was very anxious to erect this pillar at her own expense,
and I believe made the offer to the Lieutenant-Governor. She
also wished to build a fine ghāt at the Trivenī, which, in conjunction
with the magnificent one she was then building at
Benares, might have carried her name to posterity.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—My friend Mrs. B⸺ and her four children arrived;
she is to accompany me to Calcutta: and a Manis has been
sent me to add to my collection.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 1st.</i>—We quitted Allahabad, and proceeded down the
river, calling on those friends <i>en passant</i> of whom I wished to
take leave. At Mirzapore the head of a ravine deer was given
me. Off Patna a quantity of arwarī fish were brought alongside
for breakfast; they were delicious; the remainder we had
smoked in <i>shakar</i> and <i>chokar</i>—that is, coarse sugar and wheat
bran: let no one neglect this economical luxury,—the smoked
arwarī are delicious.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Both the boys being very ill of fever, we hastened on
for medical assistance. At night, as Mrs. B⸺ was quitting my
boat to go to her own, passing down the plank, it upset, and she
was thrown into the river; it was as deep as her waist; the
night was dark, and the stream strong; she was saved by a
bearer’s catching her gown as she was sinking; fortunately
the bearer was in attendance, carrying a lantern. The rest
of the people were on the shore eating their dinners, which
they had just cooked. I called to the dāndīs to assist, not a
man would stir; they were not six yards from her, and saw her
fall into the river. I reprimanded them angrily, to which they
coolly answered,—“We were eating our dinners, what could we
do?” Natives are apathetic with respect to all things, with the
exception of rupees and <i>khānā-pīnā</i>—that is, “meat and drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—To avoid the return of the accident of yesterday, this
evening our vessels were lashed together; I went to my friend’s
boat to see the poor boys, who were delirious; on my return I did
not see that the hold of my boat was open; the shadows deceived
me in the uncertain light, and meaning to jump from the railing
of her vessel upon the deck of my own, I took a little spring,
and went straight down the hold: falling sideways with my
waist across a beam, the breath was beaten out of my body for a
moment, and there I hung like the sign of the golden fleece.
The people came to my assistance, and brought me up again;
it was fortunate the beam stopped my further descent. I was
bathed with hot water, and well rubbed with dēodar oil, which
took off the pain and stiffness very effectually.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Anchored at Monghir; sent to the Sītā Khūnd, and
bottled off a quantity of water for use on board ship; it keeps
good for ever, that bright, beautiful, sparkling water from Sītā’s
well; we had the precaution to bring corks with us.</p>

<p>The interview between Runjeet Singh and the Governor-General
has taken place,—it must have been a fine sight;
had I not been going to England I would have seen the
meeting. Miss Eden presented Runjeet Singh with a picture
of the Queen, painted by herself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Extract from a letter dated December 3rd, 1838.</i></p>

<p>“I will endeavour to give you some idea of what is going
forward in the grand army of the Indus. The day after our
arrival Lord Auckland held a durbār, at which Runjeet Singh
paid his visit; my squadron was on escort duty, so that I saw
nothing, and was nearly crushed by the line of elephants. I
heard two guns were drawn up in one of the tents to be presented
to the Maharāj; between them shrapnell shot were piled
so awkwardly, that Sir Henry and Runjeet stumbled over them,
and very nearly pitched on their noses, and this will doubtless
be considered a bad omen. On the 30th Lord Auckland
returned the visit; our Regiment and the 2nd Cavalry formed the
escort: we crossed the Sutlej over a bridge of boats to the Seik
encampment, where 40,000 men are collected. The disposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
of Runjeet’s troops was most judicious; the road was first lined
with his regular cavalry, tall men, but miserably mounted; these
were all dressed in scarlet, and looked tawdry and ridiculous: at
the termination of this line of cavalry, which extended about a
quarter of a mile, was a sandbank sufficiently high to obstruct
all further view, except of the Zamburuks, who were placed on
the elevation, and fired a salute from their camels as the Governor-General
passed. Having ascended the bank, the view
was indeed magnificent, and I question if such a pageant has
been seen since the decline of the Moguls. The road was now
lined with infantry to the arch leading to Runjeet’s tents, and
before which the Maharāj’s line of elephants was drawn up
magnificently caparisoned. The infantry were dressed in scarlet,
with red turbans, three deep on one side, and two deep on the
other: these are the tallest body of men I ever saw. I think
in the front rank there could not have been a man under six
feet, and several must have been four and six inches higher;
some of the standard-bearers were perfect giants in height, the
officers were superbly dressed, and I saw more than one wearing
pearl epaulets. Only think of that; for the life of me I could
not help wishing to let the right squadron amongst them for
one little half hour. In the centre of this line of infantry,
extending more than a quarter of a mile, the Governor-General
and Runjeet met, and, after embracing, proceeded to the durbār.
Having passed through the arch, we found ourselves in an
enclosure formed by khanāts of about four acres, and in this Runjeet’s
body-guard were assembled, dressed in new Kincab dresses,
and as magnificent as silk, and gold, and embroidery, and sumptuous
arms could make them. The tents were beautiful, made
of the finest fabric of Cashmere, and such as could only belong
to the lord of that enchanting valley. Runjeet differed much in
appearance from what I had been led to expect. He is a little
man, and appeared less from being seated between two such
very tall men as Lord Auckland and Sir Henry Fane; he is
very dark for a Seik, his face is rather full than otherwise, his
beard grey, but far from white, the expression of his countenance
is that of great cunning and intelligence, and constantly varying;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
and if you did not know his character, I think you would say
there was no outward sign of determination.</p>

<p>“Runjeet was the only plainly-dressed man in his court; he
wore a dress and turban of dark red, without jewels or ornaments
of any description whatever, whilst his nobles were cased
in superb cuirasses and choice armour, and were literally glittering
with jewels, and oh! such shawls! no lady patroness of
Almack’s in her wildest dreams ever imagined such a collection.
Amongst the presents Runjeet has given to Lord Auckland is a
gold bed,—may he sleep on it as sound as I do on my little
charpoy!</p>

<p>“We have just returned from a grand review of the whole of
the troops for Lord Auckland and Runjeet; all very fine, I hear,
and we surpassed ourselves in a charge—Shavash! Shavash!
Cawnpore is a water-meadow to this place, the clouds of dust
would be incredible if we did not know we are advancing to
<i>Dust</i> Mohamed’s country.</p>

<p>“This day week, it is said, we are to continue our march,
but there are no supplies on the road for us. Shah Sūjah’s
Contingent have advanced, and I fully expect to see them some
fine morning coming back with at least a flea in their ear. Nobody
knows what is to be done, only the first division under Sir W.
Cotton marches forward, the second remains here as a reserve.
No one seems to imagine there will be any fighting, but we shall
march down to Shikarpore, and, I suppose, having secured the
safe and free navigation of the Indus, march through Candahar,
if the ruler of Cabul will not listen to the reasoning of our
Government.</p>

<p>“The crowd at the durbār before mentioned, which took
place on the 30th, was beyond bearing, and the band-master,
who must be a wag, played ‘We met, ’twas in a crowd;’ and
this was by far the best thing that transpired at the visit of the
Lion of the Punjab, and the Governor-General of India.</p>

<p>“On returning from the durbār, Runjeet stopped at the
flank of the troops lining the road, and had Major Pew’s camel
battery paraded for his inspection, and he seemed much pleased
with it. Major Pew may well be proud of having first adapted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
the powers of the camel to the artillery service, for its success
has exceeded the highest expectations that were formed of it.
Several of Runjeet’s parade horses were drawn up opposite my
squadron, they were all large, fat, northern horses, and appeared
highly broke; they were most sumptuously caparisoned.</p>

<p>“I forgot to mention that Major Pew’s camel battery had
accompanied us from Delhi. Four camels are attached to each
gun, in strong and well-constructed harness; and in no instance
was there any delay on the road. There can be no doubt whatever
of the camel being a better beast of draught than the bullock;
and in this country, unless where very rapid manœuvres are
to be effected, I think superior to the horse. A driver is seated
on each camel; the animal requires comparatively little care or
breaking, and thrives upon scanty food; he walks along at the
rate of nearly—if not quite—four miles an hour, and the team
will trot away with a gun at eight, and keep this pace up for
a distance if required.</p>

<p>“The guard I before mentioned at the gate of the durbār
were superbly dressed in yellow silk (the favourite colour of the
Seiks), some of them in curious and delicate chain armour, and
all most sumptuously armed. There was some little difficulty
in persuading this magnificent guard to allow us ingress; at
length, however, this was permitted, and I found myself in a
square of about four acres, artificially laid out as a garden with
shrubs and flowers, which must have been brought from a considerable
distance. This space was enclosed with canvas walls
seven feet high, and in it were collected the body-guard, all
armed with sword and matchlock, the stock curiously inlaid
with gold, or silver, or ivory. There was no mistaking Runjeet
Singh, from the loss of his left eye; he is not emaciated, as I had
been led to expect, from debauchery; and has not the hooked
nose usually found among the Seiks. The Lion of the Punjab
was by far the most plainly-attired man in his court; he wore
the same dress he appeared in when he visited Lord Auckland;
he had not decked himself in any of the jewels of immense
value which he has in his possession, and I was disappointed at
not getting a glimpse of the Koh-i-Nūr, which he generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
exhibits on his person on great occasions. I fear Shah Sūjah
has little chance of ever recovering this inestimable diamond,—who
knows, in a few years, in whose possession it may be
found? Shah Sūjah’s ancestors plundered it from the treasure
of Nadir Shah after he was assassinated, and Nadir Shah
extorted it from the great Mogul after the massacre at Delhi.</p>

<p>“Those of the Seik court who were admitted to the durbār
were most superbly dressed, some in flowing yellow or bright
red silk dresses, their kummerbunds always a Cashmere
shawl of very great value; some in high-polished cuirasses,
and others in choice and glittering armour; and all appeared
decked in jewels of immense value. I should mention,
Runjeet has wrested Cashmere from the rule of Cabul, and
will, perhaps, restore the unequalled valley to Shah Sūjah
with the Koh-i-Nūr; however, at the Seik court, under a tent,
formed, as it were, of immense shawls, seemed to be collected
the very choicest fabrics of that heavenly country; whilst all
that superb armour, jewels of inestimable value, silks of the
richest manufacture, ornaments of pure and elaborately wrought
gold, shawls of the finest texture and most beautiful colours and
patterns, and embroidery curiously worked on cloth of velvet,
here met the eye. Even those in the retinue who were very
far too inferior to gain admittance to the durbār, or hardly to
the presence of those who appeared there, wore shawls of such
beauty, as would have excited the envy of our richest ladies.
Immediately in front of the Maharaj and Lord Auckland, the
never-failing nāch was exhibited; the singer was covered with
jewels, and wore a dark green dress, very tastefully embroidered
in silver, and she modulated her voice sufficiently, not to make
herself very disagreeable. The presents were now handed round,
and we took our leave. The Seiks, like a sensible people, never
shave the face, and would almost as soon cut their throats as
their beards. I did not get back to my tents until late, but
returned very highly gratified with the superb pageant I had
witnessed; it would be difficult to picture a more magnificent
spectacle.”</p>

</div>

<p>My correspondent here mentions, that the presents given by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the Seiks were handed round on trays;—a far less military style
than that adopted by the Rajpūt, whose shield always forms the
tray which contains his offerings.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—When in the Hills, roaming in the interior, I met with
an accident, a fall: coming down a rock, my long silk gown
having caught on a projecting part of it, I was thrown headlong
down; therefore I made a dress more suited for such expeditions,
a black Paharī dress, somewhat resembling Turkish
attire. My fair companion admired it exceedingly, and made
one for herself after the same fashion; large round sailor-looking
straw hats completed the costume: they were comfortable
dresses on the river. My ayha, who accompanied me to the
bazār last night, told me the natives said to her, “Ayha, ayha,
is that a man or a woman?”—“A man.” “Ayha, tell the
truth, is it a man or a woman?”—“A man.” “Then why are
you with him?”—“Oh, the sāhib brought me to bargain for
things in the bazār.” I asked her why she had said I was a
man? She replied, “They are great thieves, and if they think
you a man they are less likely to attempt to rob the boats.”
Her stratagem amused me. The purchases I made were certainly
not feminine, consisting of sixty-five bamboos and some shot;
and I superintended the fixing of some brass work on a musket
that was out of repair.</p>

<p>We are at this moment surrounded by a great number of
boats; the people belonging to them are singing and playing on
all sorts of uncouth instruments; such a hum, and such a din!—it
will be useless to attempt to rest until these perturbed
spirits have sung themselves to sleep.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Off Pointy, where the river is rapid and dangerous,
we saw two vessels that had been just wrecked. The owner of
the land (the jamīndar) was taking up the cargo from the
wrecks; half becomes his share, and the owners of the vessels
have only the remainder.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—A stormy day; during a lull we attempted to cross
the river; half-way over a heavy wind rendered my boat
unmanageable, and we were driven by the wind upon a clump
of bamboo stumps that were just above water in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
the stream: the crew were alarmed, and shouted “Rām! rām!
āh’e Khudā! āh’e Khudā!” Fortunately, the boat being strong
and new, she did not split open, and after a time we got her off
again; the wind then drove us up a creek, and we lugāoed on a
sandbank. The gale separated me from my fair friend, whose
boat was driven to the opposite side of the river; her people
were calling to know if I were safe; it was impossible to rejoin
her; she heard the answering shouts of my men in the distance,
and was satisfied. We were like the Brahmanī ducks, the
chakwā chakwī, separated by the river, and calling through the
live-long night “ā’o, ā’o,” “come, come.”</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—We anchored below the village of Downapūr, which
had been washed away into the river during the last rains, by
the force of the current having undermined its banks. My
fair friend and I roamed in the beautiful moonlight by ourselves,
attired in our Paharī dresses and straw hats, to a village at some
distance. The women took us for cadets, and ran away in a
great fright; nor was it for a length of time we could bring an
ugly old hag to a parley; at last we succeeded, and bought a
Bengalee goat and kid; the villagers were excessively afraid of
us, and with great difficulty we persuaded them to bring the
goats to the vessel. They asked my companion where her
regiment was stationed; and imagined my wife was <i>parda nishīn</i>
on board the boats. We did not undeceive them with respect
to our manhood.</p>

<p>On my return I asked the sentry on my boat, “What hour is
it?” The man answered, “When <i>Honey</i> is perpendicular over
the mast it is midnight; it must now be eleven.” His <i>Honey</i>
are the three stars in Orion’s belt.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Anchored below Sooty on the Bhagirathī. I was
awakened from my sleep at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> by the servants saying my
cook had been missing since 7 in the evening; his age is twenty;
and he had never quitted the boats before. We looked over all the
boats, and searched the <i>jāngal</i> for miles around, and we began
to fear a tiger might have taken him off, knowing that gentlemen
are in the habit of coming to this part of the country tiger-shooting.
My friend became uneasy, and was anxious to go to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
the opposite side of the river; to this I objected, offering to keep
a bonfire blazing before the boats all night, but refusing to quit
the spot until the boy’s fate was ascertained. At last he was
discovered on the top of my boat, hanging over the side as if he
had fallen there; on moving him he groaned as if in severe agony,
and appeared senseless; his jaw was locked, his eyes were fixed, and
turned up under the lids. The poor fellow had been exposed in this
state to the dews of a Bengal night for three hours. They brought
him into my cabin, he fell into the most violent convulsions,
and appeared dying. All the remedies for fits were applied;
we placed him in a warm bath; after three hours and a half his
jaw relaxed, his eyes moved as if the pressure was off them, and
being better, the servants carried him, still apparently senseless,
into the cook-boat. I had been up with him four hours in a damp
foggy night, anxious for his recovery; his father was our cook,
and this young native had been with us eleven years under his
father. Mrs. B⸺ said, “I heard a native hint to another
that the boy is not in a fit; and I have heard natives will sham
illness, and deceive any body.” I called a servant, and asked
him if it were true. The man, standing on one leg, with the
palms of both hands clasped together, said, “What can I say?
will you forgive me? If you were my master I would tell you;
but how can I utter such words of shame to my mistress? Say
you will forgive me for uttering such words, and I will tell you,
if you order me to do so.” He then related what had passed,
and said, the boy, hearing himself called, became alarmed, hid
himself, and, on being discovered, shammed illness.</p>

<p>I desired the chaprasī to take a little riding whip in his hand,
and accompany me into the cook-boat; the boy was better,
but had not recovered from his fit,—the violent convulsions had
gone off. I ordered the head man to cut off his hair, and apply
leeches to his head; during the operation the itching of his head
made him put up his hand and scratch it. I saw from his
countenance he was angry, for the shaving of the head is, I
believe, the sign of complete slavery with a native, and he found
it difficult to sham illness. The operation over, the <i>khalāsī</i>
gave him a sharp cut with the whip over his hand, desired him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
leave off shamming, and come on deck. Finding his imposition
was discovered, he got up, and in the most impudent manner
said, “What fault have I committed?—what have I done that is
wrong?” When I told a chaprasī to take charge of him, and
take him to the nearest magistrate, the cook fell at my feet,
confessed his crime, and begged I would not send him away;
requesting a panchāyāt might be held on his conduct, or that I
would punish him according to my pleasure. I told the people
to hold a panchāyāt according to their own customs, to report
the sentence to me, and it should be carried into execution.
The whole of the people assembled in council under a sacred
tree on the bank, and deliberated on the case: at the termination
of the consultation the elders came to me saying
they had decided as follows:—The cook was to receive twenty-two
lashes, that he was to lose caste, and to have his <i>hukka panī
bāndh</i>—that is, they would no longer allow him to associate
with themselves, eat or smoke with them, or worship with the
faithful. They requested I would turn him out of the boats,
that they should be allowed to take him on shore, put him on
an ass with his face to the tail of the animal, and followed by
drums, and the hooting of the rabble, they should lead the
donkey through the village, and then turn him off for ever.
This was a severe sentence, and showed how angry the people of
his own caste had become: they gave him the twenty-two lashes,
he lost caste, and was not allowed to worship on deck as usual.
I would not turn him out of service, knowing it would be his
ruin, and I felt compassion for his pretty young wife, whom he had
left at Allahabad; nor would I allow them to parade him on an
ass. The panchāyāt took into consideration the conduct of the
under-woman; the servants had told her if she had hidden the
cook any where, if she would tell he should be released, and
nothing should be said about it: that they would not awaken
me; they only wanted to find him. She swore she had not
seen him at all; she was present during the four hours he was
pretending to be ill,—she saw how much alarmed I was,—also
that during this time I was exposed to the night air; and she
aided in the deception. They condemned her according to law,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
but as the sentence was very severe, I only allowed a part of it
to be put into execution. She was obliged to blacken her own
face with soot and oil as she sat on deck; all the servants came
round her,—they laughed, hooted, and complimented her on
her beauty; she cried bitterly,—the punishment was severe
enough; she was afraid she should be paraded on the donkey, and
was very glad to find I would not allow it. The next day she
wanted the cook to marry her, and make her a Musalmanī,
saying, her husband on her return would cut off her nose, and
break into the zenāna of the cook. However, she was disappointed
in her wish of becoming a follower of the Prophet, it
being discovered she had another lover: this extra lover also
lost caste, and had his <i>hukka panī bāndh</i>.</p>

<p>Knowing the natives are apt to administer poison in revenge,
I mentioned the circumstance to my khansaman, and said, “It
is immaterial to me, but, in case of my death, you will be
answerable to the sāhib.” The man made his salām, saying,
“On my head be it: you have punished the man justly; there
is nothing to fear: had he been punished unjustly he might
have revenged himself by putting poison in your food.”
“Very well,” said I, “it is your concern, not mine;”—and I
finished my dinner.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Arrived at Berhampūr, at which place a bearer of
mine related the following history:—</p>

<p>“In former times, when the English first came to <i>Kalkut</i>
(Calcutta), a very rich merchant resided at Moorshedabad, by
name Jugger Seit: this man was a great <i>harām-zāda</i> (rascal),
never obeyed the orders of the Nawāb, was very rich, and had
two hundred soldiers as a body-guard. One day he boasted
that he could day by day dethrone such a Nawāb as the one at
Moorshedabad, and daily place a new one on the throne: these
words having been reported to the Nawāb, he sent two soldiers
to seize the merchant. While the man was bathing in the river,
away from his attendants, the soldiers fell upon him; and one
of them having stabbed him in the side, they carried him before
the Nawāb. He offered as his ransom to strew the road from
Moorshedabad to Delhi with gold mohurs; but the Nawāb was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
inflexible. The merchant was fastened into a palanquin, placed
in a small boat, carried out into the river in front of the
Nawāb’s house, and thrown palkī and all into the stream,
where of course he was drowned.” So ends the tale of the
Nawāb, the Merchant, and the Palkī.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—Remained at Berhampūr, to write letters, buy silks,
also figures of men and animals beautifully carved in ivory, and
to procure food.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Quitted Berhampūr. I have suffered so much during
the last twelvemonth from the death of relatives and friends,
that I now bid adieu to the past year without regret. May the
new one prove happier than the last!</p>

</div>

<p><i>1839, Jan. 1st.</i>—We flew down the river on a powerful wind,
until we reached Cutwa, where we moored, to purchase a <i>gāgrā</i>,
a brass vessel for holding water; <i>gāgrās</i> and <i>lotas</i> are manufactured
at this place, as are also <i>churīs</i>, bracelets made of the
<i>sankh</i>, the conch shell which the Hindūs blow. These churīs
are beautifully white, very prettily ornamented, and are worn in
sets: above them, some of the women wore immense bracelets
of silver or of pewter, according to the rank of the wearer;
those bracelets stand up very high, and the pewter ones shine
like silver, from being scrubbed with sand daily in the river.
At this place a number of people were bathing; one of the
Bengalī women was remarkably well formed, my attention was
attracted by the beauty of her figure; her skin was of a clear
dark brown, with which her ornaments of red coral well contrasted;
her dress, the long white <i>sarī</i>, hanging in folds of
graceful drapery around her; but her face was so ugly, it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
quite provoking;—so plain a face united to so well-formed a
figure.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>—At Nuddea the tide was perceptible, and the smell of
the burnt bodies on the opposite side of the river most
annoying.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—Anchored at Culwa, to get the wooden anchor filled
with mud and bound up with ropes; the process was simple
and curious, but it took five hours to accomplish the work.
Bamboos were tied to the cross of the anchor, which was of
heavy wood,—a bit of old canvas was put inside, and filled
with lumps of strong clay,—the bamboos were then pressed
together, and the whole bound with ropes; a very primitive
affair. I had a new cable made before quitting Prāg,—a necessary
precaution; for unless you have it done beforehand they
will detain you at Culwa to do it, as the hemp is a little cheaper
there than in the up-country, and the mānjhīs do not care for
the annoyance the detention of three or four days may occasion.
At Culwa I saw a shocking sight: a dying Bengalī woman
was lying on a mat by the river side, her head supported by a
pillow, and a woman sitting at her side was fanning her with a
pankha. At a certain time the body is laid in the water up to
the waist, prayers are repeated; and at the moment of dying the
mud of the holy Ganges is stuffed into the nose and mouth,
and the person expires in the fulness of righteousness. My
people told me that, if the woman did not die by night-time, it
was very likely they would stuff her nose and mouth a little too
soon with the holy mud, and expedite her journey rather too
quickly to another world! The Hindūs, up-country men, who
were with me, were disgusted with the Bengalee customs, and
violent in their abuse. Should she recover she will take refuge,
an outcast in the village of Chagdah.</p>

<p>We anchored at Santipūr. The water of the river at the
ghāt was covered with drops of oil, from its being a bathing-place,
and the Bengalīs having the custom of anointing their
bodies daily with oil.</p>

<p>A chaprasī of mine, seeing a skull, struck it with a bamboo
and cursed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>“Why did you strike and curse the skull?” said I.</p>

<p>“It is a vile Bengalī skull; and those sons of slaves, when
we ask a question, only laugh and give no answer.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they do not understand your up-country language.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, that may be the reason; but we hate them.”</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—Two miles above Calcutta:—the day was fine, the wind
very heavy, but favourable: the view of the shipping beautiful;
I enjoyed it until I remembered my crew were up-country men,
from Hurdwar, who had never seen the sea, and knew not the
force of the tides. We drifted with fearful velocity through the
shipping; they threw the anchor overboard, but it would not
hold; and away we went, our great unwieldy boat striking first
one ship then another; at length a gentleman, seeing our
danger as we were passing his pinnace, threw a rope on board,
which the men seized, and having fastened it, brought up the
vessel. All this time I was on deck, under a burning sun, and
we did not anchor until 12 at noon; consequently, that night I
was very ill, the beating in my head fearfully painful, and I
fainted away three times; but it was of no consequence, I was
in the hands of a kind friend, and soon recovered.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—The ships lie close to the drive near the Fort, and
visiting them is amusement for a morning. I went on board
the “Earl of Hardwicke,”—she could not accommodate me;
thence I proceeded to the “Madagascar,” and took one of the
lower stern cabins for myself, for which I was to give 2500
rupees; and a smaller cabin, at 1300 rupees, for my friend’s
three children, who were to accompany me to England. At the
same time I engaged an European woman to attend upon me
and the young ones. Going to sea is the only chance for the
poor boys, after the severe fever they had on the river, from the
effects of which they are still suffering.</p>

<p>The larboard stern cabin suits me remarkably well; it is very
spacious, sufficient to contain a number of curiosities; and
before the windows I have arranged a complete <i>forest</i> of the
horns of the buffalo, the stag, and the antelope.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—A steamer towed the “Madagascar” down the river,
and the pilot quitted us on the 22nd, from which moment we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
reckoned the voyage actually commenced; it is not counted
from Calcutta, but from the Sandheads, when the pilot gives
over the vessel to the captain, and takes his departure. Suddu
Khān, my old khansaman, who had accompanied me thus far,
now returned with the pilot: the old man must have been half-starved,
he would eat nothing on board but a little parched
grain, and slept outside my cabin-door; he is an excellent
servant, and says he will take the greatest care of the <i>sāhib</i>
until my return.</p>

<p>I suffered severely at the Sandheads from <i>mal de mer</i>, on
account of the heavy ground-swell; perhaps no illness is more
distressing,—to complain is useless, and only excites laughter;
no concern on the subject is ever felt or expressed. Why is
blind man’s buff like sympathy<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>?</p>

<p>Let no one be tempted to take a lower stern cabin; mine was
one of the largest and best, with three windows and two ports;
nevertheless it was very hot, the wind could not reach it; it was
much less comfortable than a smaller cabin would have been on
the poop.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—Very little wind in the early morning; during the day
a dead calm,—very hot and oppressive. How a calm tries the
temper! Give me any squall you please, but spare me a
calm.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—The ship rolling and pitching most unmercifully;
there is scarcely wind enough to move her; she lies rolling and
pitching as if she would send her masts overboard; thermometer
87°—the heat is most distressing,—no wind: caught a shark
and a sucking fish.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 1st.</i>—Thermometer 87°, the heat is distressing: a return
voyage is much hotter than one from England. Captain Walker
is very attentive to his passengers; he keeps an excellent
table, and every thing is done to render them comfortable. We
have sixty invalids on board,—wretched-looking men; one
of them, when the ship was going seven knots an hour,
threw himself overboard; a rope was thrown out, to which
he clung, and they drew him in again; he came up sober<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
enough, which it was supposed he was not when he jumped
overboard. Fortunate was it for the man that the voracious
shark we afterwards caught, whose interior was full of bones,
did not make his acquaintance in the water.</p>

<p><i>March 4th.</i>—The morning was fine, the sea heavy, and we
came in delightfully towards the Cape: the mountains of Africa
were beautiful, with the foaming breakers rushing and sounding
at their base. The lighthouse and green point, with its white
houses, were pleasing objects. The view as you enter the Cape
is certainly very fine: the mountains did not appear very high
to my eye, accustomed to the everlasting snows of the Himalaya,
but they are wild, bold, and picturesque, rising directly
from the sea,—and such a fine, unquiet, foaming, and roaring
sea as it is! The Devil’s Peak, the Lion, and Table Mountain,
were all in high beauty; not a cloud was over them. The
wreck of the “Juliana” lay near the lighthouse; and the
“Trafalgar” was also there, having been wrecked only a week
before.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—Breakfasted at the George Hotel; fresh bread and
butter was a luxury. Drove to Wineburgh to see a friend, and
not finding him at home, we consoled ourselves with making a
<i>tiffin</i>—that is, luncheon,—on the deliciously fine white water
grapes from his garden. Proceeded to Constantia, called on a
Dutch lady, the owner of the vineyard, whose name I forget;
she, her husband, and daughter were very civil, and offered us
refreshment. We walked over the vineyard; the vines are cut
down to the height of a gooseberry bush, short and stumpy;
the blue grapes were hanging on them half dried up, and many
people were employed picking off the vine leaves, to leave the
bunches more exposed to the sun; the taste of the fruit was
very luscious, and a few grapes were sufficient, they were too
cloying, too sweet. They told us it took an amazing quantity of
grapes to make the Constantia, so little juice being extracted, in
consequence of their first allowing the bunches to become so dry
upon the vine; but as that juice was of so rich a quality, it rendered
the Constantia proportionably expensive. The old Dutchman
took us up a ladder into an oak tree, in which benches were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
fixed all round the trunk; he took great pride in the breadth of
it, and the little verdant room formed of the branches was his
favourite place for smoking. The acorns I picked up were
remarkably large, much larger than English acorns. Oaks grow
very quickly at the Cape, three times as fast as in England; but
the wood is not so good, and they send to England for the wood
for the wine-casks, which is sent out ready to be put together;
they think their wine too valuable for the wood at the Cape.
There was no wine-making going on at the time, but the lovers
of Constantia may feel some disgust at knowing that the juice is
pressed out by trampling of the grapes in a tub;—an operation
performed by the naked feet of the Africanders, who are not
the most cleanly animals on earth.</p>

<p>How much the freshness of the foliage and the beauty of the
country through which we drove delighted me! The wild
white geranium and the myrtle were both in flower in the
hedges. After a sea-voyage we devoured the vegetables,
the fish, and the fruit, like children turned loose amongst
dainties.</p>

<p>Our voyage from Calcutta to the Cape had been a very fine
one—forty-two days; the shortest period in which it has been
accomplished was thirty-one days, by a French vessel. The
<i>mal de mer</i> that had made me miserable from the time the
pilot quitted us never left me until we were within four or
five days’ sail of the Cape; then image to yourself the delight
with which I found myself on shore. Eatables—such as sardines,
anchovies, &amp;c.,—are more reasonable than in Calcutta;
one shilling is equivalent to a rupee. Visited a shop where
there is a good collection of stuffed birds; bought a Butcher
bird,—it catches its prey, sticks it upon a thorn, and devours it
at leisure: small birds are one shilling each; but I know not
if they are prepared with arsenical soap, like those to be purchased
at Landowr. No good ostrich feathers were to be had at
the Europe shops: there is a shop, kept by a Dutchwoman,
near the landing-place, where the best—the uncleaned ostrich
feathers—are sometimes to be bought; the price about five
guineas per pound. My man-servant gave twenty shillings for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
eighteen very fine large long feathers in the natural state, and
he told me he made a great profit by selling them in town.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—I was just starting to dine with an old friend, when I
was told a South-easter was coming on, and I must go on board
at once; there had been no South-easter for some time, and it
was likely to blow three days. The Table Mountain was covered
with a white cloud, spread like a table-cloth over the summit,
and the wind blew very powerfully. My friend hurried me off,
saying instances had been known of ships having been blown off
the land during a South-easter, leaving the passengers on shore,
and their not being able to return for them. A gentleman
offered the boatman who brought us on shore five pounds to
take us to the “Madagascar,”—she was lying three miles from
land; the man did not like the wind, and would not go. A
boatman with a small boat said he would take six of the party
for thirty shillings. When we got fairly from land the little
boat pitched and tossed, and the waves broke over her, running
down our backs; it was a very dark evening, we made the
wrong vessel, and as we got off from her side I thought we
should have been swamped; then there was the fear of not
making our own ship, and being blown out to sea. Very glad
was I when we were alongside, and still more so when my feet
were on her deck,—the little boat rose and sunk so violently
at the side of the vessel. How the wind roared through
the rigging! The South-easter blew all night, and abated in
the morning, when those who had been left on shore came on
board.</p>

<p>A friend came to say farewell, and brought me a large hamper
full of the finest grapes, pears, and apples,—a most charming
present. I and the three children feasted upon them for
ten days: how refreshing fine grapes were at breakfast!
and such grapes! I never tasted any so fine before. From
a Newfoundland ship near us I purchased several baskets of
shells.</p>

<p>There was a little squadron of fishermen’s boats all out
together, and hundreds of birds were following the boats, resting
on the water at times, and watching for the bits of bait thrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
away by the fishermen, which they picked up—it was a pretty
sight.</p>

<p>The mountains certainly are very wild and beautiful; there is
vegetation to the top of Table Mountain, 3500 feet. Landowr,
on which I formerly lived, is 7500 feet above the sea; and
that is covered with fine trees, and vegetation of all kinds,
all over the summit.</p>

<p>At Constantia, at Mr. Vanrennon’s vineyard, his wife complained
greatly of the emancipation of the slaves: some of them
were unwilling to be free, some of them were glad that freedom
procured them idleness; their wages being high and food cheap,
the emancipated people will only work now and then. The
slaves collect in Cape Town, they work for a week, the wages of
seven days will supply them with rice and fish for a length of
time; and until forced by necessity, they will not work again.
They will prepare the land, but when the harvest is to be cut,
they will not cut it unless you give them a sum far beyond
their wages; and if you refuse to submit to the imposition, the
crops must rot on the ground. The thatching on the houses at
Constantia is most beautifully done, so correct and regular, and
every thing there looks neat, and clean, and happy.</p>

<p>There are several sorts of grapes at the Cape, the purple, and
the white Pontac grape, of which the Constantia wine is made.
The white sweet pod, a long grape; the sweet water, a round
white grape; and a round purple grape;—they are all very fine.
The medical men prescribe nothing to old Indians but grapes,
grapes, as many as they can eat; that is the only medicine
recommended, and the best restorative after calomel and India.
The Hindoos, as they call us Indians at the Cape, approve highly
of the prescription. The Cape horses, which are fine, and the
cows, delighted me; there were some excellent and strong mules
also. The delights of shore after having been cooped up in a
ship, only those who have made a long voyage and have suffered
from <i>mal de mer</i> can understand; or the pleasure of roaming at
large on the quiet, firm earth, the sweet smell of the fields, no
bilge water, no tar, no confinement.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, a Bengal civilian, gave a good account of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
an expedition he made into the interior for about three hundred
miles from the frontier with a Madras civilian. They got deer
in abundance, zebra, and Guinea fowls, and saw lions in flocks.
Fancy twelve of the latter gambling together near a small pool
of water. They travelled in a waggon drawn by twenty bullocks,
and took three Hottentot boys with them as servants,
and fifteen horses, of which they lost all but one by theft or
accident. He did not go, by many hundred miles, as far into
the interior as Mr. Harris, not, in fact, into the hunting ground
for elephants and camelopards: he spoke of Harris’s work,
which is very interesting: he knew Mr. Harris, says he is a fine
fellow, and from what he saw believes his accounts to be
unexaggerated. What a brilliant country for sport!</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen of this party broke his collar-bone:
they met with some Italians who came to them for protection;
they also met with twelve lions, upon which they made off and
got home again as fast as they could. My tale is a lame one;
I have forgotten their adventures, but suppose the twelve lions
did not eat the twenty bullocks, or how could the party have
got home again?</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—Quitted Cape Town on a fine and powerful wind; we
were all in good spirits; the change had done us good, and we
had gathered fresh patience—the worst part of the voyage was
over—for a man in bad health what a trial is that voyage from
Calcutta to the Cape!</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—Very cold weather: this frigate-built ship is going
nine knots an hour, and rolling her main chains under water.
In the evening, as I was playing with the children on deck at
oranges and lemons, we were all thrown down from the ship
having rolled heavily; her mizen-top-gallant mast and the main-top-gallant
mast both broke; one spar fell overboard, and the
broken masts hung in the rigging.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—At 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we arrived at St. Helena: the view of the
island is very impressive; it rises abruptly from the sea—a
mass of wild rocks, the heavy breakers lashing them; there
appears to be no shore, the waves break directly against the
rocks. The highest point is, I believe, two thousand feet; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
island appears bare and desolate as you approach it. A white
heavy cloud hung over the highest part of the mountain; the
morning was beautiful, and many vessels were at anchor. I
sketched the island when off Barn’s Point. The poles of the
flagstaffs still remain, on which a flag was hoisted whenever the
emperor appeared, that it might tell of his whereabouts, giving
him the unpleasant feeling that spies were perpetually around
him. I went on shore in a bumboat that had come alongside
with shells. Landing is difficult at times when the waves run
high; if you were to miss your footing on the jetty from the
rising and sinking of the boat, you would fall in, and there would
be little chance of your being brought up again. There are only
two points on the island on which it is possible to land, namely,
this jetty and one place on the opposite side, both of which are
strongly guarded by artillery. Batteries bristle up all over the
rock like quills on a porcupine. The battery on the top of
Ladder Hill may be reached by the road that winds up its side,
or by the perpendicular ladder of six hundred and thirty-six
steps. We went to Mr. Solomon’s Hotel, and ordered a late
dinner; the prices at his shop and at the next door are very
high: he asked twelve shillings for articles which I had purchased
for five at the Cape.</p>

<p>Procured a pass for the tomb, and a ticket for Longwood, for
which we paid three shillings each. Next came a carriage
drawn by two strong horses, for which they charged three
pounds. We ascended the hill from James’s Hotel; from the
summit, as you look down, the view is remarkably beautiful;
the town lying in the space between the two hills, with the
ocean in front, and a great number of fine vessels at anchor.
The roads are good, and where they run by the side of a precipice,
are defended by stone walls.</p>

<p>The tomb of the emperor is situated in a quiet retired spot at
the foot of and between two hills. Three plain large flag-stones,
taken from the kitchen at Longwood, cover the remains of
Napoleon: there is no inscription, nor does there need one; the
tomb is raised about four inches from the ground, and surrounded
by an iron palisade formed at the top into spearheads.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
Within the palisade is still seen a geranium, planted by one of
the ladies who shared his exile. The old willow has fallen, and
lies across the railing of the tomb, withered, dead, and leafless.
Many young willows reared from the old tree shade the tomb,
and every care is taken of the place by an old soldier, who
attends to open the gate, and who offers to visitors the water
from the stream which now flows out of the hill by the side of
the tomb. Its course was formerly across the spot where the
tomb is now placed; it was turned to the side to render it less
damp: the water is remarkably pure, bright, and tasteless. It
was under these willows, and by the side of this little clear
stream that Buonaparte used to pass his days in reading, and
this spot he selected as his burial-place.</p>

<p>A book is here kept in which visitors insert their names:
many pages were filled by the French with lamentations over
their emperor, and execrations upon the English. Many people
have made a pilgrimage from France to visit the tomb, and
on their arrival have given way to the most frantic grief and
lamentations.</p>

<p>Having pleased the old soldier who has charge of the tomb,
with a present in return for some slips of the willow, we went
to a small and neat cottage hard-by for grapes and refreshment.
It is inhabited by a respectable widow, who, by offering refreshment
to visitors, makes a good income for herself and family.
We had grapes, peaches, and pears, all inferior, very inferior to
the fruit at the Cape. After tiffin we proceeded to Longwood,
and passed several very picturesque points on the road. Around
Longwood there are more trees, and the appearance of the
country is less desolate than in other parts of the island. We
were first taken to the old house in which the emperor lived;
it is a wretched place, and must ever have been the same. The
room into which you enter was used as a billiard-room: the
dining-room and the study are wretched holes. The emperor’s
bed-room and bath is now a stable. In the room in which
Buonaparte expired is placed a corn-mill! I remember having
seen a picture of this room: the body of the emperor was lying
near the window from which the light fell upon the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
corpse. The picture interested me greatly at the time, and was
vividly brought to my recollection as I stood before the window,
whilst in imagination the scene passed before me. How great
was the power of that man! with what jealous care the English
guarded him! No wonder the women used to frighten their
children into quietness by the threat that Buonaparte would
come and eat them up, when the men held him in such awe.
Who can stand on the desolate and picturesque spot where the
emperor lies buried, and not feel for him who rests beneath?
How much he must have suffered during his sentry-watched
rambles on that island, almost for ever within hearing of the
eternal roar of the breakers, and viewing daily the vessels
departing for Europe!</p>

<p>In the grounds by the side of the house are some oak-trees
planted by his own hands; there is also a fish-pond, near which
was a birdcage. The emperor used to sit here under the firs, but
as he found the wind very bleak, a mud wall was raised to protect
the spot from the sharp gales of the sea. After the death of
Napoleon the birdcage sold for £175.</p>

<p>We quitted the old house and went to view the new one,
which was incomplete at the time of the death of the emperor;
had he lived another week he would have taken possession of it.
The sight of this house put me into better humour with the
English; in going over the old one, I could not repress a
feeling of great disgust and shame. The new house is handsome
and well finished; and the apartments, which are large and
comfortable, would have been a proper habitation for the exiled
emperor. The bath daily used by him in the old dwelling has
been fitted up in the new; every thing else that could serve as
a relic has been carried away.</p>

<p>In the grounds were some curious looking gum-trees covered
with long shaggy moss. The heat of the day was excessive; we
had umbrellas, but I had never before been exposed to such
heat, not even in India. The sea-breeze refreshed us, but the
sun raised my skin like a blister; it peeled off after some days
quite scorched.</p>

<p>We returned to dinner at Mr. Solomon’s Hotel. Soup was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
placed on the table. Dr. G⸺ said, “This soup has been
made of putrid meat.” “Oh no, Sir,” said the waiter, “the
soup is very good; the meat smelt, but the cook took it all out
before it came to table!” A rib of beef was produced with a
flourish; it was like the soup,—we were very glad to send it out
of the room. We asked to see the landlord; the waiter said
he was over at the mess: we desired him to be sent for, of
course supposing he was sending up dinner to the officers of a
Scotch regiment, whose bagpipe had been stunning our ears,
unaccustomed to the silver sound. What was our surprise
when we found the hotel and shopkeeper was dining with the
officers of the regiment! King’s officers may allow of this,
but it would never be permitted at the mess of a regiment
of the Honourable Company; perhaps his being sheriff
formed the excuse. It was too late to procure dinner from
another house; the boatmen would wait no longer, and our
hungry party returned on board to get refreshment from
the steward.</p>

<p>The night was one of extreme beauty—the scene at the jetty
under the rocks was delightful; the everlasting roar of the
breakers that at times dash over the parapet wall, united with
the recollections awakened by the island, all produce feelings
of seriousness and melancholy. There is a cavern in the rock
which is nearly full at high water, and the rush into and retreat
of the waves from that hollow is one cause of the great noise
of the breakers.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Birds were offered for sale in the street; they appeared
very beautiful; the St. Helena red birds, the avadavats, Cape
sparrows, and green canaries were to be purchased. I dislike
birds in a cage, although I took home four parrots from
Calcutta, two of which died off the Cape during the
rolling and pitching of that uneasy sea. Quitted St. Helena
at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>Our Indian wars, propped up by the old bugbear of a Russian
invasion, and the discovery of one thing, at least, the intrigues
of Russian emissaries, seem to have excited more than usual
interest in England, Her Most Gracious Majesty having been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
pleased to notice our preventive movements to the north-west
in her speech on the prorogation of the House. The 16th
Lancers are amongst the fortunate who are actually to return.
All speak of the campaign as most distressing from climate and
privation of all sorts, and the popular king, the beloved of his
subjects, turns out to be as popular as Louis le Desiré. In
February 1839, M. le Général Allard, that most agreeable and
gentlemanlike man, died at Peshawar. How much I regretted
that circumstances prevented my accepting his escort and invitation
to visit Lahore! I should have enjoyed seeing the
meeting between the Governor-General and the old Cyclops
Runjeet Singh.</p>

<p>We have received a letter from a friend in the 16th Lancers;
he says, the thermometer is 108° in tents; that they have
suffered greatly, both man and horse, for want of supplies; that
camp followers are on quarter, and the troops on half allowance,
receiving compensation for the deficit. The army set out
on their march from our provinces in the highest spirits,
dreaming of battle, promotion, and prize-money,—they are
now to a man heartily sick of a campaign which promises
nothing but loss of health—no honour, no fight, no prize-money,
no promotion.</p>

<p>The following are interesting extracts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Jellalabad, Oct. 28th, 1839.</p>

<p>“Soon after the army left Shikerpūr in the end of
February, our difficulties commenced; and we no sooner got
on the limits of what is laid down in the maps as a <i>marshy</i>
desert, than we suffered from a very great scarcity of water, and
were obliged to make long and forced marches to get any:
through the Bolan Pass we got on tolerably well; the road
winds a great part of the way up the shingly bed of a river, and
the halting places were like the sea-beach. But no sooner
had we arrived at Quetta, in the Valley of Shawl, than the
native troops and camp followers suffered in earnest; the former
were placed on an allowance of half a seer, and the latter of a
quarter daily; and grain was selling at two seers for a rupee.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
In this manner, proceeding more like a beaten army than an
advancing one, the cavalry not supplied with any grain, and
falling by tens and twenties daily, we reached Candahar. It
has always appeared to me a mercy that we had up to this point
no enemy to oppose us. We remained two months in Candahar,
where we recruited a good deal in the condition of our
horses, but the heat was excessive, 110° in our tents, and the
men became unhealthy. From Candahar to Ghuznee we got
on better, and the storm and capture of that fort had a wonderful
effect on our spirits. Ghuznee, naturally and by art made a
very strong fortification, was most gallantly carried, and with
very trifling loss; the cavalry of course had nothing to do, nor
have we through the campaign, though we have been harassed
and annoyed more than at any period of the Peninsular War.
As to the country we have passed through from the Sir-i-Bolan
to the boundary of the hot and cold countries, two
marches from this nearer Cabul, there is a great sameness, with
the exception of the outline of the mountain scenery, which
has always been wild, rugged, and magnificent; but the total
absence of trees, and almost entire want of vegetation, excepting
near the towns of Quetta, Candahar, and Cabul, and some
very few villages situated near a stream, give an appearance of
desolation to the whole country we have passed through. It
may be described, with a few excepted spots, as a howling wilderness.
With the people I have been much disappointed: from
what I had read in Elphinstone and Burnes, I had expected to
meet a fine brave patriotic race, instead of which, to judge from
what we have seen, they are a treacherous, avaricious, and
cowardly set of people; even as bands of robbers and murderers
they are cowardly, and in the murders of poor Inverarity of ours,
and Colonel Herring, it appears they did not venture an attack,
though both were unarmed, till they had knocked their victims
down with stones. If these rascals had been endowed with
courage and patriotism, we never should be here. I should
describe the Afghāns as mean, avaricious, treacherous, cowardly,
filthy, generally plunderers and thieves, and universally liars,
and withal extremely religious. No one has ever visited Cabul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
without speaking with delight of its streams, and mountains,
and gardens extending for miles, and the endless quantities of
delicious fruit and flowers displayed in shops through the
bazārs, with a degree of taste that would be no discredit to a
Covent Garden fruiterer. Cabul itself is situated in a valley, or
rather a hole in a valley, surrounded on three sides by hills; the
scenery in all directions is beautiful, but least so towards Hindostan.
In the city there are four pakka bazārs, arched, and the
interior decorated with paintings of trees and flowers so as almost
to resemble fresco. The surrounding country is prodigiously
fertile and excellently cultivated; the fields are divided by
hedges of poplar and willow-trees; and for the first time since
leaving England, I have seen the European magpie. On the
20th of August we lost Colonel Arnold, who had long remained
almost in a hopeless state: his liver weighed ten pounds; I do
not think he ever recovered the attack he had when you were
at Meerut. At Colonel Arnold’s sale, sherry sold at the rate
of 212 rupees a dozen; bottles of sauce for 24 rupees each,
and of mustard for 35 rupees. At Colonel Herring’s sale,
1000 cigars, or about 1 lb., sold for upwards of one hundred
guineas!—this will tell you how well we have been off for such
little luxuries. We left Cabul on the 15th inst., and the
following morning, passing through a defile, was as cold a one
as I ever felt in my life; from the splashing of a stream the
ice formed thickly on our sword scabbards and the bottoms
of our cloaks; and now the heat is as great in the day as at
Meerut,—such are the vicissitudes of climate in this country!</p>

<p>“The Afghāns, in their own traditions, claim descent from
Saul, King of Israel, and the ten tribes; they invariably allow
the beard to grow, and shave a broad stripe down the centre of
the head; the beard gives an appearance of gravity and respectability
to the lowest of the people. The Afghāns are good
horsemen, and appear to have fine hands on their bridle; and
they never tie their horses’ heads down with a martingale. In
this country there is a strong useful description of horse, which
reins up well, and appears to go pleasantly, but the best of
these are brought from Herat. Here they shoe their horses with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
a broad plate of iron, covering the whole sole of the foot, with
the exception of the frog.</p>

<p>“What I have said of the Afghāns of Candahar will apply
to all we have seen; but perhaps at Cabul the men may be
shorter and more thickly set. I have never seen a more hardy,
sturdy-looking, or more muscular race, and the deep pomegranate
complexion gives a manly expression to the countenance.
Of the women we have seen nothing, but hear they are beautiful;
those taken at Ghuznee were certainly not so; they are
frequently met walking in the city, or riding on horseback
seated behind a man, but universally so closely veiled that you
cannot detect a feature of the face, or in the slightest degree
trace the outline of the figure. It is a pity Dost Muhammad
was not selected as our puppet king, for Shah Sūjah is neither a
gentleman nor a soldier, and he is highly unpopular among his
subjects, who—but for our support—would soon knock him off
his perch.</p>

<p>“My squadron was on picquet near a village surrounded with
gardens, with a clear rapid stream of water running through it;
and in this village, between two or three miles north-east of
Ghuznee, is the tomb of the great Shah Mahmoud, which has
stood upwards of eight hundred years, and which is an object of
particular veneration to all true believers. The entrance from
the village is by a low coarse doorway, which leads to a small
garden; a paved footway conducts to an arched building, undeserving
of notice: on either side the footpath are hollowed
figures of sphinxes in white marble, and seemingly of great
antiquity, and through these sphinxes water used to flow
from the mouth; above them also, there were other small
fountains. From the building I have mentioned, a rudely
constructed vault or passage—a kind of cloister—leads to
another small garden, at the end of which stands the mausoleum
of the Sultan Mahmoud, the doors of which are said to have
been brought by the Sultan as a trophy from the famous Hindoo
temple of Somnaut, in Guzerat, which he sacked in his last
expedition to India; they are of sandal-wood, curiously carved,
and, considering their very great age, in fine preservation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
although they have in two or three places been coarsely repaired
with common wood. These doors are, I should think, about
twelve feet high and fifteen feet broad; and are held in such
estimation, though it is upwards of eight hundred years since
they were removed from Guzerat, that, it is said, Runjeet Singh
made it one of his conditions to assist Shah Sūjah in a former
expedition, that he should give up the sandal-wood gates; but
this was indignantly rejected. In truth, I saw nothing particular
about these doors, and if I had not been told of their age, and
of their being of sandal-wood, I should have passed, taking
them for deal, and merely observed their carving. Over the
doors are a very large pair of stag’s horns (spiral), and four
knobs of mud, which are the wonder of all true Musalmāns,
who firmly believe in the miracle of their having remained
uninjured and unrepaired for so many centuries. The mausoleum
itself can boast of no architectural beauty, and is very coarsely
constructed. The tombstone is of white marble, on which are
sculptured Arabic verses from the korān, and various coloured
flags are suspended over it, so as to protect it from dust.
Against the wall at the head of the tomb is nailed up the
largest tiger’s skin I ever saw, though it had evidently been
stretched lengthwise. When the picquet was relieved I rode
into Ghuznee by the Cabul road, by the side of which, at some
distance from each other, are two lofty minarets,—one, I should
think, one hundred, and the other one hundred and twenty feet
in height: these are built of variously-shaped bricks, elaborately
worked in various devices: the base of both these pillars is
octangular, and rises to half the height, looking as if it had
been built round the pillar itself, which is circular; or as if the
pillar had been stuck into this case: the easternmost pillar is
the highest and most elaborately decorated. I think I before
observed that these minarets at a distance look like prodigious
eau-de-cologne bottles. The mausoleum of Sultan Mahmoud,
and these minarets, are now the only remains of the ancient
city of Ghuznee; and nothing further exists to show the magnificence
of the Ghuznee kings, or to mark the former site<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
of a city which eight centuries ago was the capital of
a kingdom, reaching from the Tigris to the Ganges, and
from the Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf. The present town
is computed to contain about six hundred miserable houses.
So much for greatness!—Such in the East is the lapse of
mighty empires.”</p>

<p><i>1839, March 19th.</i>—A fine and favourable breeze bore the
“Madagascar” from St. Helena, and gave us hopes of making
the remainder of the voyage in as short a space of time as that in
which the first part had been accomplished. The only really good
fruit we got at James’s Town was the plantain. Some mackerel
was baked and pickled on board, but we were recommended not
to eat it after the first day, as the St. Helena mackerel, if kept,
is reckoned dangerous.</p>

<p><i>April 11th.</i>—How glad I was to see the polar star, visible the
first time this evening! I thought of my dear mother, and how
often we had watched it together; and the uncertainty of what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
might have occurred during my voyage to the dear ones at home
rendered me nervous and very unhappy. The southern hemisphere
does not please me as much as the northern; the stars
appear more brilliant and larger in the north.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—The ship was passing through quantities of sea-weed,
supposed to be drifted from the Gulf of Mexico; it is always
found in this latitude. The children amused themselves with
writing letters to their mother, and sending them overboard,
corked up in empty bottles.</p>

<p><i>May 7th.</i>—Polidorus, the great pet parrot, died; the pitching
of the vessel and the cramp killed the bird, in spite of the
warmth of flannel: of our four birds one only now survived;
and very few remained of twenty-four paroquets brought on
board by the crew. A flight of paroquets in India, with their
bright green wings and rose-coloured necks, is a beautiful sight.</p>

<p>The education of a paroquet is a long and a serious affair;
a native will take his bird on his finger daily, and repeat to it
incessantly, for an hour or two at a time, the name of the deity
he worships, or some short sentence, until the bird—hearing the
same sounds every day for weeks or months together—remembers
and imitates them. If in a cage, it is covered over with a
cloth, that the attention of the birds may not be diverted from
the sounds: sometimes a native will let the bird down a well
for an hour or two, that it may be in darkness, while, lying on
the top of the well, he repeats the daily lesson.</p>

<p>Many birds are worshipped by the Hindūs, of which the
principal is Gŭroorŭ, whose feathers are of gold, with the head
and wings of a bird, and the rest of his body like a man, the
<i>vahan</i> of Vishnŭ, who rides on his back; and at times, the bird
god, in the shape of a flag, sits on the top of Vishnŭ’s car,—the
lord of the feathered tribe, the devourer of serpents.
When the Hindūs lie down to sleep they repeat the name of
Gŭroorŭ three times, to obtain protection from snakes.</p>

<p>The bird <i>Jŭtayoo</i> is the friend of Rama, and is worshipped at
the same festival with him.</p>

<p>The <i>Shŭnkŭrŭ Chillŭ</i>, the eagle of Coromandel, the white-headed
kite, commonly called the Brahmanī kite, is considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
an incarnation of <i>Dūrga</i>, and is reverenced by the Hindūs, who
bow to it whenever it passes them.</p>

<p><i>Khŭnjŭnŭ</i>, the wagtail, is a form of Vishnŭ, on account of
the mark on its throat, supposed to resemble the Shalgrama.
The Hindūs honour it in the same way they do the eagle of
Coromandel.</p>

<p>The peacock, the goose, and the owl, are worshipped at the
festivals of Kartikŭ, Brŭmha, and Lukshmēē. If, however, the
owl, the vulture, or any other unclean bird, perch upon the
house of an Hindū, it is an unlucky omen, and the effect must
be removed by the performance of an expiatory ceremony.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—A heavy gale with squalls,—it continued three days;
we were under storm-sails, the sea washing over the guns. It
was a beautiful sight, the waves were like a wall on one side of
the ship, the wind was contrary, and the wearing round the
vessel in a heavy sea was extremely interesting to me, from not
having been at sea so long. While the storm was blowing I
thought of all the idols in the hold,—of Ganesh, and Ram,
and Krishnjee, and felt a little alarm lest the “Madagascar” in
a fit of iconoclastic fury, should destroy all my curiosities. In
such a gale, to appear on deck in the attire usually worn by an
English lady was impossible—delicacy forbad it; therefore I put
on my Pahārī dress, and went out to enjoy the gale. As I
passed on to the poop I overheard the following remarks: “I
say, Jack, is that ere a man or a woman?” to which the sailor
replied, “No, you fool, it’s a foreigner.” On another man’s
asking “Who is it?” he received for answer, “That ere lancer
in the aft-cabin.” The black velvet cap, somewhat in appearance
like a college or lancer cap, perhaps inspired the bright
idea, as the dress itself is particularly feminine and picturesque,
and only remarkable on account of its singularity.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—The gale abated, leaving a strong contrary wind and a
heavy sea. We passed a small vessel,—merely a large boat
battened down; she was from Lisbon, bound to London; the
men wore high leather boots reaching above their knees; every
wave broke over her, and ran out on the other side,—it was a
fearful sea for such a little vessel. Four men were on board;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
they hailed us to know the latitude and longitude, and found
their calculations erroneous. The captain invited the master on
board; they threw overboard a cockle-shell of a boat, in which
the master and one of the men came alongside: it was beautiful
and fearful to see that little boat on the waves,—they were still
so tempestuous. The two men came on deck; the master was
the finest specimen of the veteran sailor I ever beheld,—a strong,
fine man, weather-beaten until his face looked like leather, frank
and good-humoured,—he pleased us all very much. They had
been beating about where they then were for the last fortnight,
and had had hard work of it. We exchanged spirits and tobacco
for delicious Lisbon oranges, and all parties were pleased. The
old sailor returned in the cockle-shell to the larger boat, and we
all watched his progress with interest; they pulled her in, and
we soon bade adieu to the orange vessel.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—For some time we had been busy arranging for going
on shore, which I determined to do if possible at Plymouth;
therefore my packages of curiosities were got up,—at least as
many as I thought I could take with me, being nine chests; and
all the buffalo and stags’ horns were in readiness. About thirty-five
miles from Plymouth a pilot vessel came alongside, and we
calculated on landing in her in four hours. At 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, having
taken leave of the captain, who had shown us the greatest
attention during the voyage, we went—a large party—on board
the pilot vessel: no sooner did we enter her than the wind
changed, the rain fell, it was very cold; we were forced to go
below into a smoky cabin, the children squalled, and we all
passed a most wretched night.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—We arrived at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> May-flowers and sunshine were
in my thoughts. It was bitterly cold walking up from the boat,—rain,
wind and sleet, mingled together, beat on my face. I
thought of the answer of the French ambassador to one of the
<i>attachés</i>, who asked why the Tower guns were firing,—“Mon
ami, c’est peut-être qu’on voit le soleil.”</p>

<p>Every thing on landing looked so wretchedly mean, especially
the houses, which are built of slate stone, and also slated
down the sides; it was cold and gloomy;—no wonder on first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
landing I felt a little disgusted. I took a post-chaise, and drove
to the house of that beloved parent for whose sake I had quitted
the Hills, and had come so far. The happiness of those
moments must be passed over in silence: she laid back the hair
from my forehead, and looking earnestly at me, said,—“My
child, I should never have known you,—you look so anxious, so
careworn!” No wonder,—for years and anxiety had done their
work.</p>

<p>The procession from the Custom House was rather amusing;
the natural curiosities passed free, and as the buffalo and stag-horns
were carried through the streets, the people stopped to
gaze and wonder at their size. Having left my young friends in
the “Madagascar,” it was necessary to go to town to receive them.
I went up in the mail from Devonport; its fine horses pleased me
very much, and at every change I was on the look out for the
fresh ones. We went on an average ten miles an hour. One
gentleman was in the mail. I was delighted with the sides of the
hedges covered with primroses, heatherbells, and wild hyacinths
in full bloom; nor could I repress my admiration; “Oh! what
a beautiful lane!” “A <i>lane</i>!” said the man with frowning astonishment,
“this is the Queen’s highway.” I saw the error I
had committed; but who could suppose so narrow a road between
two high banks covered with primroses, was the Queen’s highway?
Every thing looked on so small a scale; but every thing
brought with it delight. When the gruff gentleman quitted the
mail, he gathered and gave me a bunch of primroses; with
them and a bouquet of lilies of the valley I was quite happy,
flying along at the rate of a mile in five minutes. In the cold
of the raw dark morning they took me out of the mail thirty
miles from London, and placed me in a large coach, divided into
six stalls, somewhat like those of a cathedral: a lamp was
burning above, and in a few minutes we were going through a
long, dark, dreary tunnel. It was very cold, and I felt much
disgusted with the great fearful-looking monster of a thing
called a train: in a short time we were at the end of the thirty
miles, and I found myself once again in London. On my
arrival I was exceedingly fatigued; all the way from Landowr<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
I had met with nothing so overcoming as that day and night
journey from Devonport to town. To every person on a return
from India, all must appear small by comparison. Devonshire,
that I had always heard was so hilly, appeared but little so; and
although I was charmed with a part of the drive from Devonport
to Exeter, with the richness of the verdure, and the fine
cows half hidden in rich high grass, and the fat sheep, still
I was disappointed—Devon was not as hilly a country as I had
fancied. Oh the beauty of those grass fields, filled as they
were with buttercups and daisies! During seventeen years I had
seen but one solitary buttercup! and that was presented to me
by Colonel Everest in the Hills. The wild flowers were
delightful, and the commonest objects were sources of the
greatest gratification. I believe people at times thought me
half mad, being unable to understand my delight.</p>

<p>At the time I quitted England it was the fashion for ladies to
wear red cloaks in the winter,—and a charming fashion it was:
the red or scarlet seen at a distance lighted up and warmed the
scenery;—it took from a winter’s day half its dulness. The poor
people, who always imitate the dress of those above them, wore
red, which to the last retained a gay and warm appearance, however
old or threadbare. On my return all the women were
wearing grey, or more commonly very dark blue cloaks. How
ugly, dull, dingy, and dirty, the country people generally looked
in them! even when perfectly new they had not the pleasant
and picturesque effect of the red garment.</p>

<p>In Wales I was pleased to see the women in black hats, such
as men usually wear, with a white frilled cap underneath them:
it was national, but not a red cloak was to be seen.</p>

<p>What can be more ugly than the dress of the English? I
have not seen a graceful girl in the kingdom: girls who would
otherwise be graceful are so pinched and lashed up in corsets,
they have all and every one the same stiff dollish appearance;
and that dollish form and gait is what is considered beautiful!
Look at the outline of a figure; the corset is ever before you.
In former days the devil on two sticks was a favourite pastime.
The figure of the European fair one is not unlike that toy. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
the <i>bustle</i>,—what an invention to deform the shape! It is a pity
there is no costume in England as on the Continent for the
different grades in society. Look at the eyes of the women in
church,—are they not generally turned to some titled fair one,
or to some beautiful girl, anxious to catch the mode of dressing
the hair, or the tye of a ribbon, that they may all and each
imitate the reigning fashion, according to the wealth they may
happen to possess? This paltry and wretched mimickry would
be done away with if every grade had a fixed costume.</p>

<p>I went to Mr. Greville’s, Bond Street, to look at some birds,
and took a list of his prices, which I have annexed, with those of
Mr. Drew, a bird-stuffer at Plymouth<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. My scientific friends
preferred the birds in the state in which they came from India,
therefore they remain <i>in statu quo</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the novelties I have beheld since my return, the railroads
are the most surprising, and have given me the best idea
of the science of the present century. The rate at which a
long, black, smoking train moves is wonderful; and the passing
another train is absolutely startling. The people at the stations
are particularly civil; there is no annoyance, all is pleasant and
well conducted. From the velocity with which you move, all
near objects on the side of the railroad look like any thing
turned quickly on a lathe,—all long stripes; you cannot distinguish
the stones from the ground, or see the leaves separately,
all run in lines from the velocity with which at full
speed you pass near objects. The New Police, now so well
regulated, also attracted notice; their neat uniform renders them
conspicuous; a wonderful improvement on the watchmen of
former days. The beautiful flowers, the moss-roses, and the
fine vegetables in town were most pleasing to the eye. The
height of the carriage horses in the Park attracted my attention;
they are fine, powerful animals, but their necks are flat, and
their heads generally appeared very coarse. They wanted the
arched neck and the fire of the horses of India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>Visited the British Museum; the new rooms that have been
added are handsome, and well filled with Egyptian curiosities;
mummies in crowds, and very fine ones. The Elgin marbles, in
a handsome hall, are also shown to great advantage. My collection
of Hindoo idols is far superior to any in the Museum;
and as for Gunesh, they never beheld such an one as mine, even
in a dream! Nor have they any horns that will compare with
those of my buffalo, or birds to vie with my eagles, which are
superb. I was in town when a fog came on at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> in the
month of October, which rendered candles, or gas-lights necessary;
it was as deep as the yellow haze that precedes a tūfan
in the East.</p>

<p>At the horticultural show at Plymouth, I was glad to see the
<i>kulga</i> (amaranthus tricolor), which not only ornamented my
garden in the East, but was used as spinach, <i>sāg</i>. How often
have we shot off the head of this plant with a pellet ball, not
only for amusement, but to improve it, as all the lower heads
then increased in size, became variegated, and the plant improved
in beauty. The <i>kala datura</i>, and the datura metel, were
also there; and my old friends, the oleanders, looking slender
and sickly. I went to the place alone, and the people expressed
their surprise at my having done so—how absurd! as if I were
to be a prisoner unless some lady could accompany me—wah!
wah! I shall never be tamed, I trust, to the ideas of propriety
of civilized Lady <i>Log</i>.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 26th.</i>—Visited Umberslade; this ancient seat of the
Archer family is about fifteen miles from Leamington in
Warwickshire. The view of the house and grounds is good
from the obelisk; the latter leans fearfully, and totters to its fall.
The mansion is a fine old handsome square building, cased in
stone, and balustraded around the flat roof with the same
material. We proceeded to the church of Tanworth, and
inspected the monuments of the family. Thence we visited
“The Butts;” a farm-house is now called by that name, of
course; the place was formerly the archery ground.</p>

<p>My love of beautiful scenery, the faint remembrance I retained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
of the mountains of Wales, and the wandering propensities inherent
in my nature, added to a desire to revisit Conway, because
the pilgrim was born within the walls, induced me to go into
Wales.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 4th.</i>—The entrance to Conway from a distance is very
beautiful; it has finer hills around it than you would be led to
suppose, judging by the views generally taken of the castle; the
suspension-bridge is handsome, and in keeping with the ancient
building. I visited the old ruin, which afforded me the greatest
pleasure, and went over the ancient walls that encompass the
town; there are fifty picturesque points of view in Conway.</p>

<p>Darkness coming on, I took refuge at the Castle Inn, a good,
comfortable, and very clean house: my dinner consisted of a
leg of the most delicious Welsh mutton, for which Conway is
especially famed, and which is more like our gram fed mutton in
the East, than any I have tasted: the English sheep are generally
large, fat, and very coarse; and the mutton is decidedly
inferior to that of India. A troutlet fresh from the river was
excellent; the Welsh ale good, and the cheerful fire was most
agreeable.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—I discovered William Thomas, an old servant, who
formerly lived with my grandmother; he keeps a small inn:
the man was very glad to see one of the family, and he became
my escort to the house in which I was born, which having been
sold by my father, is now the property of the Castle Inn. I
went over it: in the room formerly my nursery were a couple of
twins, and the landlady wished me to take lodgings there, saying
they would be very cheap in the winter. I could not find a
harper in Conway; it being the winter season, the only one they
appear to have had quitted the place; he is there during the
summer, when visitors are plentiful. Nor could I even see a
Welsh harp, which they tell me differs from all other instruments
of the same kind. With great pleasure I revisited the
old castle, admired the great hall, and the donjon keep; the
pilgrim was not born in the latter, but in “the flanking walls
that round it sweep,” that is, within the walls of Conway. The
ivy which covers the castle walls in the richest profusion is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
remarkably fine, the wall-flowers most fragrant. Irish ivy is
however larger and finer. The well-known lines—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“On a rock whose haughty brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Frowns o’er old Conway’s foaming flood”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">present to the imagination an idea of a grandeur of rock and
waterfall that you do not find near the castle. Old Conway’s
“foaming flood” is a small river flowing close to the rocky site
on which the castle is built; the rock is of slate stone, and in
digging for slate some hundred years ago the foundation of one
of the old towers was undermined, and a part fell in; the work
was stopped, and the old castle is still in fine preservation. The
oriel window in the Queen’s tower is to be admired, and the
banquet-hall must have been very handsome. Quitting the
castle I went to the church,—a very handsome old one, if
viewed from within, and very old and curious if viewed externally.
It contains some ancient and curious monuments: on a
flat stone in the chancel the name of Archer attracted my
attention; on it is this inscription:—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Here lyeth yᵉ body of<br>
Richᵈ Hookes of Conway<br>
Gent—who was the 41ˢᵗ child<br>
of his father Wᵐ Hookes<br>
Esqʳᵉ by Alice his wife<br>
and yᵉ father of 27 children<br>
who died yᵉ 20 day of march<br>
1631<br>
N.B. This stone was revived<br>
in the year 1720<br>
<img src="images/skull.jpg" alt=" "><br>
att yᵉ charge of john<br>
Hookes Esqʳᵉ<br>
and since by Thoˢ<br>
Bradley and Wᵐ Archer Esqʳᵉˢ</span></p>

<p>I find this Richard Hookes was a relation of the Archers,
which accounts for their care in reviving this curious account of
the number of his family. In the street, a little above the
Hotel, is a large and handsome house, called the Plas nwyd, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
new palace; the arms of the family to whom it belongs are
carved on the chimney-pieces, and on the ceilings. On going
down to the quay I found it was high tide; several small vessels
were there. The walls of Conway, and the castle, and the
suspension bridge, look well from this point. Next to the
gateway is a large house, the property of the Erskines: the
library is in the tower of the gateway; it is now deserted, and
falling to decay, but must have been a pleasant residence.</p>

<p>Quitted Conway on my road to Ireland. Aber Conway, as I
passed it, appeared to me very beautiful; the bridge with its
single arch, the mountains in front, the church to the left, the
stream and the trees, would form a lovely subject for a sketch.</p>

<p>The high road is fine—excellent, it is cut through, and winds
round a high rock close to the sea-shore, towards which a good
stone wall forms a rampart, and prevents any one feeling
nervous. The views in North Wales pleased me very much;
the mountains are low, but the heaviness of the atmosphere
causes clouds to hang upon their summits, to which their
height appears scarcely to entitle them. Penrith Castle is
handsome, and the stone quarries appear large and valuable. I
passed over and admired the Menai Bridge, and crossed Anglesea
in darkness. They tell me the pretty and small black cattle, so
common in Wales, come from Anglesea,—the breed of the
island. There are no wild goats in Wales, and I only saw two
or three tame ones.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—Arrived in Dublin, and proceeded to Knapton. The
country around Dublin is hilly, pretty, and has some trees;
further inland it is flat, very flat and uninteresting. The
towns swarm with beggars, who look very cold, and of an
unhealthy white, as if much illness were added to their poverty:
the Irish cabins appear abodes of wretchedness, some of them
being without a chimney, the smoke making its exit through the
door; the pigs and the naked-legged children rolling together;
and the roof looking as if its original thatching of straw was
turned into mud, so covered is it with green moss, and the black
hue of dampness. The potatoes are piled in ridges in the fields,
covered over with a few inches of earth neatly beaten down,—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
only specimen of neatness that I saw was in these potato
ridges; they are left unguarded in the field, and the Irish say,
the last thing they would think of stealing would be the
potatoes. The hay-ricks are on the same small scale as the
Welsh, but not put together nor thatched with Welsh neatness;
but the stacks of turf looked very Irish, and they were tolerably
neat. The police, who are dressed in a dark-coloured uniform,
are armed, which they are not in England. The sight of a turf-fire
has an odd appearance at first; the smell is oppressive, and
it does not appear to send out the heat of a coal-fire. The
park of Abbeyleix, with its fine trees, is a pleasing object,
surrounded as it is by a flat country of bog and swamp, and the
walks within it are delightful. I wish I had had some of the young
rhododendron trees from Landowr to plant there; I might have
brought some home in glass cases, impervious to the sea air; a
great many cases of that sort, containing rare plants, came to
England on the poop of the “Madagascar;” several of the
plants were in bloom on board, and they were all healthy on
their arrival. The hall at Abbeyleix is decorated with the skull
and horns of an enormous elk, found in one of the bogs,—a
great curiosity; there is also a woodcock, with a young one
and an egg, which were found in the grounds, and are considered
a rarity.</p>

<p>We passed a woman who appeared to be very poor from the
scantiness of her clothing; she wore her cloak over her head
instead of over her shoulders,—a fashion purely Irish; but she
did not ask for charity. My companion gave her some money;
she threw herself on her knees to thank him, and on our asking
her history, she said, “My husband is a Roman, sure it’s
myself’s the bad Protestant:” she added that she had eight
children, four of whom were dead, and the Lord be thanked;
and she wished the Lord would take the others, for they were
starving. I gave her a little money, which I made her promise
to spend in potatoes and buttermilk, because she said she would
lay it out in <i>tea</i> for the children. This new love of tea, to the
abolition of potatoes and buttermilk, adds much to the starving
state of the Irish poor; if you give them money, it is said, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
priests take one-third of it; besides which, O’Connell levies a
tribute on the poor creatures.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—This morning, a fine frost being on the ground, which
from its peculiar whiteness and brilliancy the Irish denominate
a black frost, the party at Abbeyleix and Knapton sallied forth
to shoot the woods: the keepers beat the woods for woodcocks
much in our Indian fashion of beating the jangal. During the
day I walked to the enclosed garden in Lord de Vesci’s grounds,
to see the tomb of Malichus O’More, the son of Roderick
O’More; the strong ice that was upon it rendered the inscription
difficult to decipher: it stood formerly within a few yards of its
present situation; Lord de Vesci built a hot-house on the spot,
and at the same time he removed the coffin, which is of stone,
and contains bones of gigantic size.</p>

<p>1840, <i>Jan. 10th.</i>—To-day the penny postage commenced: a
great crowd collected at the post-office, putting in letters,—which
were in vast number, as people had refrained from
writing, awaiting the opening of the penny post. The band
was playing in front of the office.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Quitted Liverpool in the train: you commence your
journey through an immense tunnel, and when a train is going
through notice is given at the other end by a whistle. The
engines puff and blow in such an angry fashion, one can
scarcely fancy they are not animated; and when they want
water, by a very simple contrivance, they whistle of themselves
to get it. Their names delight me: the “Oberon” or the
“Camilla” puff by you—puff, puff, like enraged animals. The</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">—road ought to be added, were it not for the rhyme, but must
be understood.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Rode with a friend to Clumber, the seat of the Duke
of Newcastle; the grounds are fine and extensive; the house
appeared an immense mass of heavy building: the interior may
be handsome, but the exterior is heavy and dreary-looking.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
I admired the lake very much, and the canter we took in the
park was delightful.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Visited Mr. Waljambe’s museum of British birds; it
is most excellent; and I was charmed with the silver firs in the
grounds at Osburton,—they are most beautiful and magnificent
trees.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 3rd.</i>—The following speech made by a gentleman at
tiffin amused me:—“Lord Brougham says, ‘Mankind are
divided into two classes, those who have seen my house in Italy,
and those who have not:’—now, I divide mankind into those
who have seen my Moonāl pheasants, and those who have not.
Lady William Bentinck gave them to me, and they are the
most beautiful birds I ever saw.”</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—A steamer ran against a merchant vessel that was at
anchor in the river; down she went headlong, all her crew with
her, down in a moment. At low tide four barges were brought
and fixed to her with strong chains and cables. She was then
left until the tide rose, at which time the pressure on the ropes
increased. Hundreds of people assembled to see her drawn up—the
tide rose higher and higher—the struggle was great—“Now
mud,”—“Now barges,” was the cry: the mud held her
tenaciously, the barges pulled more and more—the anxiety was
great: at last, like a cork drawn from a bottle, she rose from
the suction, came up to the surface, and was immediately taken
to the shore: some of her crew, who were asleep when she went
down, were found dead in their beds.</p>

<p><i>1841, April 20th.</i>—At the little chapel of Pennycross in
Devon, my beloved father was buried. It is situated on a hill
covered with fine trees, and commands a beautiful view,—just
such a quiet, holy, retired spot as one would select for
a last resting place. I could not summon courage to go
there before, but now I feel an anxiety to revisit it again
and again.</p>

<p><i>May 1st.</i>—Revisited the chapel of Pennycross, and took a
drawing of the tomb of my father.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="plate38" style="max-width: 43.75em;">

<p><i>12th.</i>—Went on board the “Wilberforce” steamer, which is
going with the “Albert” and “Santon” on the Niger expedition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
She has two engines, each of thirty-five horse power.
The “Santon” has only one engine: the “Wilberforce” is flat-bottomed,
but has a double keel, they tell me, that may be
drawn up at pleasure. She is ventilated, but will be horribly
hot in a warm climate—like an iron furnace. The life-buoy
appeared a good invention. One of the officers showed me an
absurd affair,—a small lantern to strap upon the chest of a man,
to purify the air he breathes when he is exposed to a pestilential
atmosphere. They showed me a number of bibles and testaments,
which they said were in the Arabic character: judging
from the slight glimpse I caught, it appeared to me to be
beautifully printed Persian. The two Ashantee princes came
on board with their tutor: they are intelligent, good-humoured,
ugly Africanders, with large blubber lips and up-turned flat
noses, and dressed like young Englishmen: how soon they will
discard their tight trowsers and small sleeves when they get
back to their own country! The crockery on board is shown to
the lady visitors, who are expected to weep on beholding the
appropriate design printed upon it:—a negro dancing with
broken chains in his hands! It made me laugh, because there
is much humbug in the whole affair—but it is the fashion. I
was rather inclined to weep when I thought what would be the
probable fate of the men then around, who were going out on
the expedition to such a dreadful climate.</p>

<p><i>July 21st.</i>—Having been recommended to visit the baths of
Schwalbach in Germany, on account of my health, I started per
steamer for Rotterdam and proceeded up the Rhine: after a
most agreeable stay at Schwalbach, and my health having
received benefit from its chalybeate waters, I returned to
England.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 8th.</i>—This day is over—I am once more alone—and
what a day of agony it has been to me—my birthday! On this
day I first beheld my beloved mother; on this day I have
placed her in her grave!—have parted with her in this world
for ever. My beloved mother has been placed in my father’s
vault in the churchyard of that quiet and beautiful little chapel
at Pennycross,—a tranquil and holy spot. O my mother! let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
me turn from your grave to the duties that are before me, and
strive to act in a manner worthy of your child.</p>

<h3>INDIAN NEWS.</h3>

<p><i>Overland letters brought me the following intelligence</i>:—</p>

<p>“<i>1839, March 25th.</i>—Her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī sent a
kharita to give me the glad tidings of the safety of the Gaja
Rajā Sāhib, and the birth of a daughter; they are both very
weak and thin, and her Highness is most anxious about her
grand-daughter, as she can scarcely take any nourishment.
They have named the child the Chimna Rajā, after the wife of
Appa Sāhib.”</p>

<p>Holding rank by courtesy, as “Aunt of my grand-daughter
the Gaja Rajā,” this newly-arrived young princess must be my
great grand-niece, for which reason perhaps she honoured me
by coming into the world on the anniversary of my wedding-day.
It is remarkable the ladies of that family are oddly
enough styled Rajā, and Rajā Sāhib.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 15th.</i>—My relative at Landowr wrote to me, saying, “I
had a very interesting letter lately from our friend Sturt, of the
engineers, from Cabul: he has been appointed engineer to
Shah Sūjah, and gets 1000 rupees a month: he had not heard
of your being in England; but he begged to be kindly remembered
to you. Here is an extract: ‘Give my best salām; I
promised her a sketch of the Hills, which I have not forgotten,
but never did one to my fancy; but she shall have one of Candahar,
Ghuznee, and Cabul, and any thing else this place
affords: would she like a lady’s dress? if so, I shall be obliged
by her accepting it from me.’ I told Sturt you were at home,
but would, I was sure, be delighted to get the sketches.”</p>

<p>How often after the death of Captain Sturt, who distinguished
himself so highly, did I regret never having received the promised
sketches, and concluded they were lost during the disastrous
retreat from Cabul! In 1848, Mr. Hullmandel showed
me the work published by General Sale, and told me the lithographs
were from sketches by Captain Sturt; that the portfolio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
was lost during the retreat of the army, but was afterwards discovered
and given to Lady Sale. With how much interest I
looked over the drawings!—in all probability they were from the
very sketches he had taken for me.</p>

<p>“<i>1840, Feb. 15th.</i>—We have just received the news of Lord
Auckland’s having been created an Earl and Sir John Keane a
Baron: what an unlucky wight Sir Henry Fane has been, to
have missed prize-money and a peerage, and having nearly been
killed by the only thing he got in the country,—a pukka fever!</p>

<p>“There is no doubt as to the expedition to China, and ‘Teas
is riz.’ It will be a short affair of a year, perhaps less; the
whole will fall on the shoulders of poor Governor Lin, who
may lose his head in addition to his two buttons.”</p>

<p>“<i>July 1st.</i>—The Bombay Government have consented to the
Bāiza Bā’ī’s residing at a place called Nassuk, on the banks of
the Godavery, not far removed from the Poona district, her own
country. Four lākh a year are to be granted her; she is to
live there on the same terms as people of her station reside at
Benares, or other places in the British territories; but it is
clearly understood that her followers are to be subject to the
rules and regulations of the country.</p>

<p>“<i>2nd.</i>—We have heard of Sir Henry Fane’s death, for
which we were sincerely sorry—poor fellow, his youthful good
fortune did not attend his last career. In the Peninsular war
he was styled ‘Main de fer.’</p>

<p>“<i>August.</i>—The Bā’ī has been unfortunate, having had a
fire in her camp which destroyed her house, shawls, &amp;c., and
property to the amount of four or five lākh: it was occasioned
by a Mahratta girl’s setting fire accidentally to the parda.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dec.</i>—The Gaja Rajā has recovered from a very severe
illness, and the little princess, the Chimna Rajā, is well.</p>

<p>“A subscription was circulated in 1835 at Allahabad for building
a church. Mr. Blunt, the Lieutenant-Governor, subscribed
1000 rupees. The building was to be done, provided the funds
were sufficient, by Colonel Edward Smith, of the engineers.
In February, 1841, the church was consecrated by the Bishop:
it does honour to the architect, being a handsome building, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
well adapted to the climate. The erection of so expensive a
church by so small a society shows great zeal in the cause of
religion in the inhabitants of Allahabad.</p>

<p>“We have just received the news of the renewal of hostilities
with China, at which I am glad. The celestials will be forced
to learn the power of the enemy they have drawn upon them.
The new Commissioner, Lin’s successor, is to be made over to
the Board of Punishment, and the admiral has been deprived of
his button. There is nothing new under the sun; our expression
of having ‘a soul above buttons’ must be derived from
the Chinese. A great man, for instance, like Admiral Kwang,
bearing bravely up against loss of dignity (<i>button</i>) and honour.”</p>

<p>“<i>1841, Feb. 15th.</i>—The Bāiza Bā’ī has crossed over to the
opposite side of the Jumna, where she remains until after the
eclipse of to-morrow. Appa Sāhib is in Sultan Khusrū’s garden,
and will not move, it is said, until some arrangement is first
made for him by the Bā’ī or the Government, if not, he says,
he will turn fakīr.”</p>

<p>“<i>May.</i>—Captain Fitzgerald, who has charge of the Bāiza
Bā’ī, and her Highness, were heard of at Nagpore; she gave no
trouble, but was dilatory on the march, the weather being
frightfully hot.”</p>

<p>“1842.—A kharita was received from Nassuk, some forty or
fifty kos from Bombay. The Brija Bā’ī, one of her Highness’s
ladies, was very <i>magrā</i>, <i>i.e.</i> discontented with the <i>hawā pāni</i>,
‘the air and water’ of the place, and complained that she saw
no <i>sāhib log</i> (gentlemen), as when at Allahabad.</p>

<p>“How little a man can estimate his real value! The last
accounts from Cabul informed us our friend Captain B⸺ was
a prisoner, and to be sold for 200 rupees! The price having
been paid, he was released from captivity.”</p>

<p>Let me record the death of a faithful servant: on quitting
Calcutta, a lame shepherd applied to be taken into employ; the
old man had been a sipahī, was wounded in action, and ever
after remained lame. When he offered himself as <i>bherī-wālā</i>
(shepherd) an objection arose on account of his lameness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
it being imagined he could never take the goats five hundred
miles up the country. “I am so lame I shall never overdrive
them,” said the man;—the reason was unanswerable, he was
taken into service.</p>

<p>The old male goat of the flock very often upsets the shepherd;
though they are always at war they are great friends.</p>

<p>Poor old Bulwan, our lame shepherd, was bitten by a mad
dog, which attacked him when he was driving it off from one of
the goats—my favourite black Bengalī, which I had commended
to his especial care; he died four days afterwards: he was sent
to the hospital, but it was too late. There seems to be no cure
but that of cutting out the bitten part, and cauterizing the
wound. We gave his son eight rupees to bury him, and shall
keep him in his father’s place if he is steady. We regret the
old man very much; we used to give him a rupee occasionally
to cheer him. Every shepherd knows his own sheep;—and my
old man not only knew his own sheep, but had a name for each
of his goats, forty-five in number. Like Dandy Dinmont’s
terriers, Pepper and Mustard, and Mustard and Pepper, the old
man derived the name of all his goats from one, his prime
favourite, a beautifully spotted Delhi goat, by name Jūmnī,—“Jūmnī’s
daughter,” “Jūmnī’s grandson’s grand-daughter’s
son,” “Jūmnī’s nephew’s grandchild,”—every kid in the flock
was traced by some means or other to the invaluable Jūmnī:
the pedigree of a race-horse was nothing in comparison to the
pedigree of the kids!</p>

<p>1843.—I will pass over my wanderings in France, Belgium, and
Germany without comment. My absence from India was prolonged
far beyond the time originally allotted me, by the deep
and numerous afflictions that fell upon me. One by one all
those I loved had sunk into the grave: mental suffering, united
to anxiety and bodily exertion, brought on severe illness, and
that buoyancy of spirit which had hitherto supported me
was gone. How can I express my gratitude to those dear
friends who nursed me with such unwearied care and affection
during a long and painful illness of nearly three months’ duration,
with which I had to struggle; until, with health regained, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
happy spirits began to resume their empire? It is a blessed
dispensation of Providence, that, “with returning health returns
that energy, without which the soul were given to us in vain;
and which enables us calmly to face the evils of our being, and
resolutely to fulfil its objects: there is but one philosophy
(though there are a thousand schools), and its name is fortitude.
To bear is to conquer our fate.”</p>

<p>On my recovery, contrary to the advice of my medical
advisers, I determined to sail immediately for the Cape, and
rejoin my husband, who had been compelled by illness to quit
India, and proceed, for the benefit of his health, to Southern
Africa. Having engaged the larboard stern cabin on the poop
of the “Carnatic,” a vessel of Captain I⸺’s, for £110
to the Cape; and having secured the services of an ayha, to
wait upon me during the voyage, I took leave of my friends,
and went to Portsmouth, to await the arrival of the ship.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 8th.</i>—Sailed from Portsmouth at noon; it was stormy,
and blew hard, but the wind was fair; the thermometer 46°—most
bitterly cold. I suffered greatly from <i>mal de mer</i>, and was
most completely wretched, so miserably cold and uncomfortable.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—In the Bay of Biscay we encountered a confusion of
seas, all huddled and jostling together; a strong following wind
sent the vessel swiftly along, the waves roaring after her, whilst,
every now and then, a sea struck her fearfully. I was too ill to
quit my couch.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—A heavy gale came on, and blew incessantly with
frightful force for two days and nights! How the ship pitched
and rolled! she groaned as if all her timbers were being wrenched
asunder; this would continue ten minutes, and then came a
pause—perfect silence for a few seconds, after which the groaning
of the timbers recommenced, and the same dead silence at
intervals; it gave me the idea that the vessel beneath me was
crazy in every beam, not sea-worthy.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—Foul wind and rain; even that was better than the
state of the vessel during the gale, which abated a little this
morning. The pitching and rolling, added to the groans of the
timbers, allowed of no rest night or day; it was to me a life of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
great suffering, added to which, the ship was badly provisioned,
and the cook a very bad one.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—The captain of the vessel told me he was never out in
such a gale before; the first officer asserted the same. His
course lay outside Madeira, but the foul wind and heavy sea, in
which the captain said the ship could not live, forced him to
decide on taking the course within the islands.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—A wild wind and heavy sea, the waves striking the
ship, and pouring over her in fearful style; the galley was
washed away, the live-stock under the large boat was nearly all
destroyed, and seven of the pigs were killed. The deck presented
a scene of marvellous confusion; the sailors, attempting
to save the live-stock, were thrown down on the deck, and the
steward, lying in the water that rushed over it, was holding on
to a pig; the animal bit his hand, the steward let go, and the
pig was washed overboard by the next roll of the ship. With
the vessel in such a state the passengers were left to shift for
themselves, and very badly off they were. At dinner-time I
crept out to get some food, my ayha having been unable to
procure any thing for me during the whole day from the steward;
the captain apologised for the dinner on table, on account of
the galley having been washed away: it consisted merely of one
great cheese, and each person was supplied with a biscuit!
Nineteen hungry cadets were there; how the boys ate!—the
great cheese quickly disappeared. Every one was in
good humour, and glad of biscuit and cheese; but the
news of the loss of so much of the live-stock was far from
agreeable.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—From the time we quitted Portsmouth until this day
I have been miserably ill with <i>mal de mer</i>, added to which, I
have scarcely been able to sleep at night, the weather has been
so constantly bad; as for the poor creatures below, they must
be nearly stifled,—the waves, which are pouring in on the one
side of the deck and out on the other, force them to keep the
hatches closed.</p>

<p>The wind was strong and against us; in the evening I saw a
beautiful meteor on the starboard bow, shooting down the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
At night I was sitting Hindūstanī fashion on my sofa, playing
on the guitar, and singing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Du, du, liegst mir im Herzen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Du, du, liegst mir im Sinn.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sea was very heavy, it blew a little hurricane; the wind
suddenly changed, and the “Carnatic” was taken aback; how
she pitched and rolled! There was an uproar on deck, but I
went on with my song,—it was useless to disturb myself for a
storm; certainly the time of the music varied as the heavy
pitching sent me backwards and forwards on the sofa.</p>

<p>The next morning the chief officer said, “I was astonished
last night when the ship was taken aback, I heard you singing
as quietly as possible all the time; I did not like it,—it sounded
like the spirit of the storm.” This remark put me in mind of
Long Tom Coffin, who, hearing a midshipman singing during a
heavy gale, requested that the captain would call him from the
gun on which he was seated, adding, “For I know, from having
followed the seas my natural life, that singing in a gale is sure
to bring the wind down upon a vessel the heavier; for He who
rules the tempests is displeased that man’s voice shall be heard
when He chooses to send His own breath on the water.”</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—A quiet day, a pleasant evening, and the first tranquil
night since I have been on board in which I have been able to
get the refreshment of a sound sleep; we are now within the
shelter of the islands.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—Another quiet day, a beautiful evening, and a quiet
night;—what a luxury! A glorious sunset: the purple clouds
stood up from the deep blue ocean like a wall, above were two
brilliant streaks of vivid green, other streaks of crimson hue
were surrounded by purple clouds, and above all a sky of
mottled deep ultramarine blue clouds, of which the edges were
of burnished molten gold, like the brilliant dyes on the back of
the mackarel. A glorious sunset after such wild gales and
drenching rains.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—A nautilus and a tortoise seen. Another sunset,
less wild than that of the evening before, but the finale was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
brilliant. The clouds drew back, and the sun—a perfect world
of fire—sank in burning brilliancy into the deep blue sea, which
did not appear to catch one tint from its vivid beams, but
remained a deep, cold, clear blue, whilst every cloud around
caught and returned the rays. In these latitudes, at sea, a
sunset is indeed a glorious sight: and what, after the evening
shades have fallen around, and the deck is quiet and nearly
forsaken, can be more calm and refreshing than the star-light
night, and the cool and delightful breeze?—luxurious hours of
dreamy contemplation.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> I saw the Peak of Teneriffe: when the sun
came out in power the Peak became beautiful,—its snowy head
ridged with furrows, and glistening like silver in the sun; deep
shadows were over the island, the shape could be traced, but
with an uncertain effect that gave it the appearance of fairy-land;
while, above the shadows, contrasted with and relieved by the
unclouded blue sky, the silvery Peak was a beautiful object.
The sea was almost perfectly calm, and a number of the nautilus
were around us.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—A beautiful day, almost a calm,—Teneriffe and Palma
appear to advantage. Several Portuguese men-of-war near the
ship.</p>

<p><i>March 1st.</i>—The trade-wind fine and steady, making us all
happy and contented: thermometer 67°,—a most agreeable
temperature. My cot came down by the run; the double-jointed
brass screws on which it hung, having had too much
work from the pitching and rolling of the vessel, broke short off;
the old-fashioned common iron screws are far better, give less
motion than the double-jointed brass ones, and will not break.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Lat. N. 17° 57′, long. W. 20° 47′.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The moon is up, but yet it is not night,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sunset divides the sky with her.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A magnificent scene was presented when the sun had disappeared
below the horizon; a most brilliant rose tint overspread
both sea and sky; clouds of the deepest neutral tint were finely
contrasted with others of burning crimson, and two vivid streaks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
of the brightest green mixed with the warm glow of sunset.
While the waves were still bright with the rose tints, and two
crimson clouds still lingered amidst those of the darkest hue,
the crescent moon arose with the old moon in her arms, and a
beautiful lunar bow was brightly visible, silver-tinted like the
moon. The captain of the ship remarked it was an uncommon
and curious circumstance; the bow remained visible some time.
The horizon darkened, meteoric lights played around the ship,
illuminating the waves with flashes of silver light, and sparkling
stars, the glow-worms of the deep. The trade-wind was
blowing, the night was fresh and pure, and most agreeable.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—Lat. N. 15° 12′, long. W. 21° 5′.—Some beautiful flying
fish were caught in the shrouds; the captain ruthlessly ordered
them to be dressed for breakfast, the flavour was delicate and
delicious. Divine service was performed for the first time. A
shark seen, and the lunar bow was in the same position as the
night before.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—Lat. 12° 43′, long. 21° 8′.—The lunar bow visible at
the same hour, brighter and of greater length; it has the
appearance of an enormously lengthy comet. The trade-wind
good.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—Lat. 11° 8′, long. 20° 40′.—Light winds; the comet or
lunar bow, whichever it may be, visible as usual.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—Lat. 9° 21′, long. 20° 55′.—The comet-like appearance
very decided, and with a telescope the star at the head was
visible. The comet appeared at twenty minutes past six <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>—disappeared
at eight <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> The light of the tail was of a brilliant
silver colour, and it was very much expanded at the end. The
crescent moon still brilliant, the sea calm.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Lat. 7° 46′, long. 20° 53′.—The comet is very distinct,
and of enormous size; it appeared in full splendour this
evening, was visible a little later than it was yesterday evening,
and disappeared about the same time as before. It was a
beautiful night, the moon, in her third quarter, was brilliant;
Orion shone forth in the deep sky, Aldebaran, the Pleiades,
and α Arietis were in full splendour, and Canopus was beautiful.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—This morning two of the young men amused themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
with swimming by the ship’s side during the calm into
which we have gradually fallen. The captain remonstrated with
them; and a shark was caught, which will prevent such folly in
future. Thermometer 85°—very warm. The comet appeared
about six, and set about eight <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>—not so bright this evening
as usual. A waveless ocean.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—A deep calm—the sunrise very beautiful, foreboding
a very warm day. In the evening the comet, although visible,
was obscured by clouds—a squall, and fresh gale at night.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—Lat. 4° 28′, long. 20° 10′.—At break of day this morning,
on looking out of the port, the glory of the scene spread
before me rendered me speechless with admiration. Who can
describe the grandeur, the glorious colours of that sunrise?
The burning crimson clouds deeply streaked with the darkest
and fullest neutral tints, spread above deep fantastically shaped
clouds that rose like mountains from the sea. Above the
burnished crimson was a bright gleam of greenish blue sky,
and above that was a profusion of clouds, in tones of still
deeper and more burning crimson, mixed with the darkest
neutral ones, spread upon a sky of the most vivid and deep
ultramarine colour—the purple waves rose and swelled glowing
with the richest rose tints. On the left, also, deep neutral
clouds stood up from the sea like a dark mountain, with
streams of crimson light thrown upon its head, in front of which
the softest, fullest, and most brilliantly white clouds contrasted
with the dark blue sea, on which they appeared to rest. The
man who dedicated the dim religious gloom and the crimson-tinted
lights of a cathedral to the service of the Almighty must
have taken the idea from the feelings inspired by such a scene,
where a gorgeous profusion of solemn tints bows the soul to
Him who hath “spread His glory in the heavens.”</p>

<p>This sunrise has repaid the toil and trouble of the voyage:
the sunsets are magnificent; but who shall describe the glory
of the rising sun, the depth of shade, the burning light;—a scene
that can never be forgotten, a glory that can never pass from
the memory, even to the last. Heavy rain in the evening, the
clouds numerous, the comet invisible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—Rainy and uncomfortable. At night under the stern
of the vessel the phosphoric light was beautiful: wishing to see
what produced it, I desired the steward to throw out the bucket:
he brought up a curious white jelly-like substance, two inches
and a quarter in length, and three-quarters of an inch in width,
at the thickest end, and shaped somewhat like a finger, covered
with rings of small globules emitting a phosphoric light of a
brilliantly transparent emerald colour. It extinguishes and
resumes the light at pleasure. I put it into a tumbler-full of
sea-water: any agitation of the water brought forth a powerful
light. By daylight the next morning it had somewhat the
appearance of a thinly haired dirty-white caterpillar, and its
rounded form had become flat; in this state it weighed one
dram one scruple; it was innocuous to the touch, it emitted no
light, and was dead.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Neptune wished to come on board, but his company
not being considered agreeable, the visit was declined, and a
present promised to him at the end of the voyage.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—The stars very bright—a lovely night in the trade
winds—the comet very high, much more vertical; the end of
the tail appeared some distance beyond Rigel in Orion—the stars
hid their diminished heads as it passed over them—it set at a
quarter past 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; its enormous magnitude was astonishing.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—The calm continued—the weather very warm—eight
vessels around us wind-bound, as well as ourselves. To amuse
the younger passengers, and pass away the time, which hung
wearily on their hands, theatricals were commenced, concerts
were given, and a newspaper was established and continued
weekly, entitled “The Comet.”</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—The Magellan clouds visible—the southern cross, with
its pointers very brilliant—the whole sky gemmed with stars—the
moon, Vesta, and Mars, remarkably beautiful.</p>

<p><i>April 1st.</i>—A glorious sunset over Trinidada and Martin Vas
rocks.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Lat. S. 24° 39′, long. W. 29° 24′. The comet, which has
been gradually diminishing in brightness, was invisible this
evening, and we never beheld it again. The stock of water is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
very low; of the live-stock very little remains, and there appears
small chance of getting on more quickly with the voyage.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Another calm: are we ever to arrive at the Cape?
The water is nearly expended; of the live-stock alone remain
three sheep, two pigs, four fowls, and one goose. The captain
talks of watering the vessel at Tristan d’Acunha. The stock is
in a melancholy condition, and the solitary lean goose has
fallen a victim to the rapacious jaws of nineteen hungry
cadets.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—A heavy sea; shipping water in large quantities,
rolling and pitching heavily; a sharp wind and strong breeze.
On the high foaming waves astern, the <i>spray bows</i>, as they call
them, are most remarkably beautiful,—like small rainbows on
the waves, four or five sometimes visible at the same time;
I watched them with great pleasure from the stern-windows.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—The sea calmer; eight albatross and numerous small
birds astern; in the evening they collected close to the vessel,
following it, and picking the bait off the hooks thrown out to
catch them.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—Three albatross caught: the smaller one measured
nine feet from tip to tip of its wings. A gentleman had the
kindness to prepare it for me with arsenical soap, and I brought
it to England.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Anchored at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> in Table Bay, after a voyage of
seventy-eight days from Portsmouth, and eighty-nine from the
Docks.</p>

<p>My arrival was unexpected, and therefore, I trust, only the
more welcome.</p>

<p><i>1843, May.</i>—Cape Town, when viewed from the sea, is beautiful
and singular; the white houses are close to the shore, surrounded
by mountains; the Devil’s Peak, the Table, and the
Lion Mountain form a fine picture, enlivened by the number of
vessels in the bay, lying close to the town. From the New
Jetty, where you land, in the early morning of a clear day, the
Blue Mountains, to the right of Robin’s Island, on the opposite
side of the bay, are very beautiful. From the Old Jetty under
the Table Mountain you see, to the right, the wreck of the
“Abercrombie Robertson,” and that of the “Reform;” these lie
near together. At the same place the “Waterloo” went on
shore, but being rotten, instantly went to pieces, and disappeared.
A little to the right, nearer the castle, are two other wrecks, now
fast disappearing.</p>

<p>The castle and the barracks are close to this jetty; the latter
was formerly the storehouse of the Dutch merchants. The
principal street in Cape Town is the Heerengracht, which runs
up from the shore: the George Hotel—the best hotel in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
place, is in this street: we went there, it was quite full, and the
passengers from the “Carnatic” found a difficulty in procuring
rooms; from its being the race-week the place was full.</p>

<p>I found my husband residing in the house of a French lady
in Roeland-street, close under Table Mountain. This house is
reckoned amongst the most respectable houses of the class, and
its situation at the farthest end of the town is desirable; you
have quiet and fresh air. Had I arrived in the summer season
at the Cape I should have preferred a house at Wynberg; during
the winter time, Wynberg being damp, the inhabitants generally
come into Cape Town. In a boarding-house there are
many inconveniences, but you are saved the trouble of house-keeping,
which to an Indian is a most vile affair; therefore I
was content to remain. The terms at a boarding-house are
seven shillings and sixpence a day for each person, which
includes one bed-room, food and wine; the food is good; the
wine, which is Cape, is only drinkable for those accustomed to
it; and the Cape beer I did not venture to taste. House-rent
is very cheap, and food also; meat, threepence per pound; an
enormous fish costs twopence; a great craw-fish one penny; a
fine fowl, thirteen-pence halfpenny; a small cart of fire-wood,
seven shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p>The reports I heard in Cape Town respecting house-keeping
in the country were not favourable; they say the houses in the
country are generally leaky, and the landlords will not repair
them; that the servants are thieves and liars, and, moreover,
extremely dirty, requiring constant overlooking in the kitchen.
The houses in Cape Town are infested with myriads of fleas—and
such fleas!—perfect monsters! They have also a fair proportion
of bugs.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—I went to the fish market, a square-walled enclosure
near the Old Jetty. The scene was curious and animated;
Malays, Hottentots, Bushmen, and queer-looking people of all
sorts, ages, and tribes, dressed out in their gayest colours, and
grinning like so many monkeys, were all huddled together selling
or buying fish. Cartloads of the most enormous craw-fish lay
on the ground, crawling about and fighting each other; and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
the ground near to them were heaps of silver-fish, and quantities
of Cape salmon, and fish without scales, with long thin bodies
and pointed heads, which were sold for one penny each,—good
when salted and smoked; and there were also a number of
queer-looking fish, of all sorts and sizes, with unpronounceable
names. The porters who attend the market carry the fish away
in baskets slung to each end of a long pole balanced on the
shoulder;—and such creatures as these porters are! I bought a
gielbeck or yellow beak, for which I paid twopence; the palate
of the gielbeck is yellow, whence its name. A Malay porter
carried it to the house on a stick through its gills, for which his
pay was also twopence,—a great price for a very short distance,
compared with the price of the fish, which was a <i>very large</i> one.
One day I met a Bush-boy dragging off a fish as long as himself;
he had a great stick over his shoulder, the end of which was
passed through one of the gills of the fish, whilst the tail of the
creature swept the ground. The high cheek-boned little black
monster laughed and grinned as I could not repress an exclamation
at his exceeding and picturesque ugliness.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—The year, they tell me, is divided into two parts, the dry
and the wet,—nine months of dry weather, and three months of
rain; June, July, and August being the cold and rainy months.
This day, the 16th of May, it is very cold, and may be reckoned
a winter month; the thermometer in my bed-room at noon 58°.
Since my arrival on the 26th April we have had daily showers,
and some few days of rain; still, between the heavy showers the
sun bursts forth, and a walk is delightful.</p>

<p>At breakfast-time a gentleman related to me an extraordinary
history respecting slavery at the Cape; the particulars are as
follow:—“The ‘Cleopatra’ has seized a Brazilian vessel—the
‘Progresso;’ she is a slaver. The ‘Cleopatra’ has taken from
her thirteen prisoners and forty-eight slaves; with these people
she has arrived at Pappendosh, a place near Cape Town, where
the slaves have been landed; the rest of the slaves will follow
in the ‘Progresso:’ she has not come in at present; she was
taken in the Mozambique Channel. The slaves will now be
examined and classed according to their ages,—the age is arbitrarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
settled. They generally arrive branded; and as without
some distinguishing mark they cannot be known, it is supposed
those who may happen to have no mark will be branded by the
authorities at the Cape. Blank indentures are to be drawn out,
in which the age of the slave, his marks, &amp;c., will be shown
forth. The slaves are generally young, and they, supposing the
age to be about ten years, will be bound to the purchaser of the
indenture until the age of twenty-one; these indentures are to
be sold by auction on the Parade at Cape Town to the highest
bidder. The slaves who may be more aged are to be bound for
a certain term of years to the person who buys them, so that
their slavery may be the same with those of earlier years.
These proceedings are under the authority of the Government;
the motive is to conciliate the Dutch, who are generally the
purchasers of the slaves.”</p>

<p>As the English hold forth that they abolish slavery, these
proceedings appear curious, and I will go, if possible, to see the
slaves sold on the parade. Although we do not originally
capture the slaves we capture the vessels when carrying them
away, take them into the Cape, and sell them for our own profit
for a certain term of years to the highest bidder at public
auction. It is mentioned in the indentures that the slaves are
to be brought up in the Christian religion. It is said the slaves
generally have no religion at all, and their masters leave them in
utter ignorance.</p>

<p>The Table Mountain is to me a source of constant enjoyment;
I delight in its varied appearance: at times a dense white vapour
is spread over it,—when that passes away, the deep clear ultramarine
blue of the sky, covered with bright clouds, forms a
background to the dark mountain, whilst, every now and then,
a stormy grey cloud passes over all, and gives a beautiful effect
of light and shade.</p>

<p>I roamed the other day up the mountain by the side of the torrent,
the bed of which is filled with large stones, over which the
stream gurgles and runs with velocity. Hundreds of women and
some few men were all employed washing clothes by beating them
upon the stones in the stream: some of the women, with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
infants tied upon their backs, were washing away, and the whole
side of the mountain was covered with linen drying on the grass.
How many of the groups would have formed an admirable
picture, in spite of the ugliness of these Malay and Hottentot
animals! They ask four shillings and sixpence, or three and
sixpence a dozen for washing clothes, but will generally take
two shillings and sixpence, including large and small. For the
ship passengers they wash very badly; for people resident in
Cape Town they wash well.</p>

<p>We accompanied a gentleman and his family up the mountain
under the Devil’s Peak; he was going to teach his boys to fire
at a target. They produced a great heavy old pair of flint
pistols, and with these they amused themselves. I was enrolled
amongst the Tyros; the two gentlemen were the best shots,—I
took rank as the third; my success charmed me, although I was
afraid of the pistol,—the crazy old weapon was so heavy I could
scarcely take aim. A few evenings afterwards a pretty young
French lady accompanied the party, and fired remarkably true.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—The sun during the day is very powerful; it does not
answer in these latitudes to expose one’s self to its rays during
the noontide heat. At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we went on the mountain to
practise pistol-shooting; we found that after sunset there was
scarcely any twilight, and warned by the very cold, sharp
exhalations from the wet ground, we quitted the spot quickly,
but not before we had all taken cold.</p>

<p><i>June 11th.</i>—The thermometer in my room at noon 53°, the
air sharp and very cold. Rambled up Table Mountain, beyond
the mill, from which place the narrow pathway is surrounded by
flowers, even at this early season. I gathered great branches of
what is called in England the Duke of York’s geranium; it was
not in flower, but the scent of the leaves was delicious; it grew
there most luxuriantly; when in blossom the flower is lilac and
white. The purple and white prickly heath, and the white
heath, were abundant; the deep orange-coloured aromatic
azalia, the bossistroph or honey-plant, the fine white arum, and
the tall slender Ixia, with its pendant crimson and graceful
blossom, and its small bulb, which shot up every here and there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
delighted me with their beauty. These plants, cultivated with
so much care in England, were growing wild in every direction
surrounding the little stony sheep-path I was ascending.</p>

<p>They say mechanics use the oil from the tip of the tail of the
Cape sheep for their machinery, and that it does not become foul
in the works. Five pounds’ weight of the <i>tips</i> of the tails of the
sheep costs two shillings and sixpence, and produces two quarts
and a half of fine clear oil, after having been melted over the
fire and strained through a flannel bag. Animals in southern
Africa appear to run to tail: see the enormous size of the tail
of the sheep into which all the fat of the body appears to be
collected: see the pretty mousehunt (a sort of fox), the Hottentot
women in Cape Town, and the Bushwomen; all these
have the beauty of the Hottentot Venus. Some of the Malays,
both men and women, are handsome: the Africanders are too
universally well known to need description.</p>

<h3>THE BUSHWOMAN.</h3>

<p>The Bojesmāns or Bushmen are a most remarkable race.
In one of my solitary rambles on Table Mountain, I came
suddenly upon three of these people, who were squatting round
a small fire in a cleft of the rock. Curiosity induced me to
stop and look at them; they appeared to dislike my presence
and scrutiny, and, as far as I could judge from the angry tone
of their words and their suspicious glances, they were glad when
I walked on.</p>

<p>The speech of the Bojesmāns is a most remarkable and extraordinary
<i>clack clack</i>—unlike any other language under the sun,
something resembling the striking together of harsh castanets.
The sketch represents a Bushwoman; it is a portrait; she has a
bunch of bulbs in her hand: they principally feed on roots and
vegetables. Her attire is of leather; coloured beads are around
her neck, her ear-rings are of ivory, a curious ornament is in
front of her body, and her <i>kraal</i> or hut is in the distance.</p>

<p>In 1847, I saw four Bojesmāns who were exhibited at the
Egyptian Hall; they were handsome specimens of their kind;
the women were younger than the one represented in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
sketch, still the peculiarity of the figure and the style of countenance
stamp them of the same race.</p>

</figure>

<p>The following extract from Harris’s “Wild Sports of Southern
Africa,” contains a most interesting description of the Bushmen:—</p>

<p>“At Kramers-fontein the next day, a horrible spectacle presented
itself to us in the form of an emaciated old Bushwoman,
who had come down from her kraal, five miles distant, to fill
two ostrich eggs with water. ‘Grim misery had worn her to
the bones,’ and it is no exaggeration to say that her attenuated
form appeared a skeleton covered with a wet cloth. Those
rounded proportions, which are given to the human form divine,
had no existence in her. Her skin resembled wrinkled leather;
and I can compare her legs and arms to nothing but straightened
sticks, knobbed at the joints. Her body was actually crawling
with vermin, with which she was constantly feeding a little half-inanimate
miniature of herself in arms.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">‘⸺Wither’d and wild in her attire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She look’d not like a habitant of earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet was on it.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We were glad to bribe her to depart by a present of tobacco;
and the wretched creature’s countenance evinced thankfulness
at our liberality.</p>

<p>“The pigmy race, of which this woman was a characteristic
specimen, usually reside in holes and crannies of rocks, and
sometimes in wretched huts, incapable of protecting them from
the inclemency of the seasons. These, their constant fear of
discovery induces them to erect in secluded spots at a great
distance from water: a precaution to which they are further
prompted by a desire to leave the pools open for wild animals,
which they occasionally shoot from an ambush with poisoned
arrows, and devour on the spot. They possess neither flocks
nor herds—are unacquainted with agriculture—and the most
wealthy can boast of no property beyond his weapons and his
starving dog. With no cares beyond the present moment, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
live almost entirely upon bulbous roots, locusts, reptiles, and the
larvæ of ants, with the habitations of which latter the country is
in many places thickly strewed. Not a trace of their hovels could
be seen from the road; and a traveller might even pass through
their country without seeing a human being, or suspecting that
it was inhabited. Such is their general distrust of visitors, that
the males would never willingly approach us, evincing great
trepidation when forced to do so—no object being more unwelcome
to their sight than a troop of horsemen on the plain.</p>

<p>“The women, who were much less shy, and who never failed
to follow the tracks of our waggons when they happened to
come upon them, with the hope of obtaining tobacco in exchange
for ostrich eggs, are of small and delicate proportions, with hands
and feet of truly Lilliputian dimensions. Their footprints
reminded us of Gulliver’s adventures, and are not larger than
those of a child. When young, they have a pleasing expression
of countenance, which they take care to render as captivating
as possible by bedaubing their flat noses and prominent
cheek-bones with a mixture of red-ochre and fat. The toilets of
many were made with scrupulous attention, the effect of the
paint being enhanced by necklaces composed of the fresh entrails
of wild beasts—a few cowrie shells, old bones, and buttons
being also interwoven with their matted hair; but the life they
lead, their frequent long abstinence, and constant exposure to
the wind and glare of light in a dry open country, soon inducing
the habit of keeping their naturally small eyes more than half
closed, their comeliness is very ephemeral, and never extends
beyond youth. The females possess much greater volubility
and animation of gesture than the men; but the sounds they
utter are a succession of claps of the tongue produced by
forcing that unruly member against different parts of the teeth
and palate: and whilst the enunciation is thus rendered troublesome
and full of impediment, it resembles rather the chattering
of monkeys than the language of human beings.”</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Thermometer at noon 52°.—Sharp and very cold: the
scarlet fever in Cape Town.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Walked to Green Point, and gathered shells beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
the second lighthouse, which is situated on a rocky shore,
where vessels are frequently wrecked, both accidentally and, it
is said, intentionally. The waves break beautifully over the
rocks that run out far into the sea. The sand on the shore
glitters like silver, being composed of fragments of pounded
shells: there are numerous shells to be found, but generally
broken by the ruggedness of the coast. The people dig for
them here, and procure them in great quantities out of the sand,
which they sift; they are sold to burn for lime, which is made
at a less cost from the shells than from the limestone quarries,
as on the latter a duty is levied by the municipality.</p>

<p>The rocks are covered with limpets of all sorts, and cockles:
the great ear shell (haliotis) is common, the coat-of-mail shell
(chiton) and other species are also numerous. The great ear
shells I have seen carried about for sale in Cape Town at twopence
each; the people consider the contents good food.</p>

<p>In Camp’s Bay, and other bays, I understand fine and perfect
specimens of a great variety of shells are found where the shore
is less rugged and the sand good. The enormous size of the
sea-weed is quite surprising, its great stem is of such length and
thickness. On removing a clump of the sea-weed, the sand is
alive with millions of wood-lice, at least I think they are so called;
they make great bounds by rolling themselves up in a ball, and
suddenly opening, the strength of the scales and the breadth of
the tail sending them on at a surprising rate. It brought to my
mind those early days in which a mouse, with a tail turned
under the body, and fixed with a bit of cobbler’s wax, was made
to jump about the room to my great delight.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Heavy rain—thermometer 56° at noon; the rain has
taken away the great sharpness of the cold, which was too
cutting to be pleasant. In these slightly-built houses, when
the thermometer was 52° under the mountain, the air was
very cold and clear, and peculiarly sharp and crisp. I roamed as
usual up the mountain; it is covered with honey bush, at
present in full flower, both the red and the white; the protea, a
sort of honey bush, is now also in flower. As I made my way
along, myriads of small sugar birds started from the bushes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
where, fluttering over the flowers, they had been dipping their
long slender beaks into the sweet juice below. The people
collect the juice which flows in great abundance from the flower
of the honey bush; they warm it, and sell it in quart bottles
at three shillings a piece to the druggists, who recommend it
for coughs.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Bought four rings of ivory, which the Kaffirs wear as
bracelets and anklets, formed after a very simple fashion. From
the hollow end of the elephant’s tusk, where it is three-quarters
of an inch in thickness, a circle is cut off one inch in breadth;
in this rude state it is worn as an ornament, three or four on
each leg and arm. Purchased a pair of bullocks’ horns, well
polished, for four shillings; but the enormous price asked for
specimens in Cape Town deterred me from making as many
purchases as I should otherwise have done.</p>

<p><i>July 5th.</i>—Heavy rain and very unpleasant weather: the
people are suffering from colds and sore throats; which illness,
they say, has been brought by the wind that blows over from
the sea between Table Mountain and the Lion’s Head.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—An illness, called by <i>the Capers</i> the Sinkings, is very
prevalent; it appears to be a swelling or inflammation of the
glands of the throat.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—The middle of the Cape winter. Auctions are conducted
on a curious principle, the lowest bidder being the purchaser:
it is a Dutch practice, and rather difficult to comprehend.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Walked beyond the hospital on the shore, where several
wrecks lie scattered—found some pretty shells. Robberies are
daily committed during the night in Cape Town by the Malays.
At this time of the year it is their custom to make presents to
their priests: the presents <i>must</i> be made, whether the men have
it in their power to offer them or not. In the latter case they
commit robbery to satisfy the demands of their spiritual advisers—several
houses have been broken into.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—Walked towards Camp’s Bay over the Lion Mountain;
sketched some Cape aloes which were growing most luxuriantly
on the road-side, where they had been planted as a hedge—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
stem was of the most brilliant crimson tint—the prickly pear
in full bloom, with its white and crimson flower, and its deep
crimson buds mixed beautifully with the aloes in the foreground;
and in the distance beyond lay the sea and the Blueberg
Mountains. I found a great variety of the most beautiful
heaths, also a number of bulbs. The Africander was in bloom,
as well as those bulbs that give forth their scent at sunset. The
Malays are extremely partial to these sweet night-scented flowers,
and collect them by the handful.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—From the foot of the Devil’s Peak I sketched the Lion
Mountain; it was covered with a deep driving fog that hung in
wreaths not unlike a mane around it; the fog covered the
shipping that was just visible below it, and the town looked
indistinct: it was a most cold and unwholesome day; but I
gathered beautiful flowers; the arums and prickly pears were in
full bloom.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Ascended the Lion’s Rump, and arrived at the signal-post
in time to see a magnificent sunset: took a sketch of the
Lion’s Head, to the right of which was the back of Table
Mountain, and the Southern Ocean to the left. The town and
the bay from this mountain are seen to great advantage; the
regularity of the plan on which the town was built by the Dutch
is excellent. The walk this evening delighted me; my young
companions and I sat down many times, and employed ourselves
with digging up the bulbs with which the mountain is literally
covered. The size of some of the bulbous roots is surprising,
one weighed three pounds and a quarter, and measured in circumference
twenty inches and a half; the height of the bulb
was five inches and a half, and the leaves were eleven inches
long. The fragrance of the flowers of the night-scented bulbs
became delicious as we descended the mountain very late in the
evening; it is rich in fine grass, and bulbs innumerable.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 4th.</i>—Visited the Botanical Garden under the Lion’s
Head; a number of trees and plants from Australia are collected
there. The most brilliant African plant in blossom was the
Strelitzia regina, with its orange and purple blossom, and its
long wand-like leaves. The Kaffir bread-tree (Zamia horrida)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
and the Zamia longifolia are very remarkable; grass trees from
Australia were there, but they had perished from the cold.
When on the Lion’s Head we saw a very curious bulb, the
hæmanthus or blood-flower; the bulb is of large size, and
produces only two leaves, which turn back and lie open upon
the ground; they have no stalk, and lie close upon the earth,
the colour a bright green; some of this class have spotted
leaves. The gardener told me that the Bushmen use the juice
of the spotted hæmanthus as poison for their arrows; and my
young companions said, when they were on the frontier they
saw a Bushman stick his arrow between the two leaves down
into the bulb, and he told them, in that manner the Bushmen
poisoned their weapons<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>In India the Hill-men from Rajmal use poison on their
arrows; it is most powerful and fatal, but they will not disclose
from what plant they obtain it. The Hill-men at Almorah
preserve the same secrecy on the subject. The hæmanthus
toxicaria has spotted leaves; of these plants there were many
in the garden, newly placed there, and they had not been there
long enough to flower.</p>

<p>Harris, in speaking of African poisons, says:—“The Bechuana,
with what truth I know not, are said occasionally to
domesticate this stately bird (the ostrich) for equestrian purposes;
and the puny Bushman avails himself of the disguise afforded
by its skin to mix with a troop of wild animals, and select his
victim. At the twang of his tiny bow away scours the herd in
dire consternation, and, more alarmed than all, off scuds the
impostor with them, again propelling a shaft as soon as the
panic has subsided. The destruction committed in this manner
is incredible: a slender reed, only slightly barbed with bone or
iron, but imbued with a subtle poison, and launched with
unerring dexterity, being sufficient to destroy the most powerful
animal.</p>

<p>“The principal ingredient of this deadly bane is said, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
Pringle, to consist of the venom of the most dangerous serpents
that infest the desert. In seizing and extracting the poison
from beneath the fangs of the fatal puff-adder, or the cobra-di-capello,
the despised African displays the most wonderful
dexterity and boldness; simply placing his naked foot on the
neck of the writhing reptile, and not unfrequently closing the
exhibition of his intrepidity by fearlessly swallowing the contents
of the bag he has extracted, as a supposed antidote, or rather as
an effectual charm against the deleterious consequence of the
venom, should it ever be accidentally brought into contact with
his blood. Being of itself too thin and volatile to retain its
powers long unimpaired, this animal poison is skilfully concocted
into a black glutinous substance, by the due admixture of
powerful vegetable and mineral poisons; the former being
generally obtained from the root of a species of amaryllis, called
by the colonists the gift-bol, or poison-bulb; whilst the latter is
an unctuous or bituminous substance, which is said to exude
from certain rocks and caverns that exist in particular parts of
the Bushman’s country.”</p>

<p>On the mountain we found the ornithogalum, the star of
Bethlehem, in abundance; it was like a weed in the garden.
The ferania was there, with its spider-like flower; and the oxalis
(woodsorrel), with its most brilliant pink flowers; the name of
the enormous bulb I was unable to discover. The Australian pine
was in great beauty in the garden; also the melaleuca kȳápootie,
with its most curious bark. When you tear off a part of it you
may separate it into layers as fine as gold-beaters’ skin, and it is
of the same colour. Another sort has a coarser bark, and is
used to cover hooqŭ snakes in India; fire-screens are made of
this bark in America, and ingeniously ornamented with beads.
The Zamia longifolia and the grass tree are distorted-looking
productions, holding in outward appearance the same place
amongst plants as a man afflicted with elephantiasis does
amongst human beings. The bottle brush tree was in full
bloom. The garden is very well worth visiting; the gardener
is civil and intelligent.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—I started to walk to the Plaat Clip, or flat stone; it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
half-way up Table Mountain; a favourite place of resort for
parties from Cape Town. It is a beautiful spot: over the broad
top of a bare rock a stream of water pours down with great
velocity, and rushes down the side, forming a beautiful but small
waterfall. Trees ornament the spot, and luxuriant bunches of
the arum in full bloom are dotted amongst the rocks with
picturesque effect. The ruin of a house stands there; its
history appears unknown,—divers romantic tales were told me
concerning this ruin. It is situated on a lovely and picturesque
spot, very attractive to a person fond of solitude. After a long
walk and much clambering among the rocks, we returned laden
with flowers. Nothing can be more agreeable than spending
the day at the Plaat Clip.</p>

<h3>A KAFIR WARRIOR.</h3>

<p><i>1843, Aug.</i>—The portrait of the Kafir warrior in the sketch represents
him with his shield of leather, of which the proper height
when placed on the ground is to reach to the chin; his assegai
or spear is in his hand, high feathers adorn his head, and we will
suppose he has left his kaross in his hut, it being the only,
and the garment usually worn by the Kafirs. This sketch of an
African Warrior may prove acceptable, as the war now being
carried on excites so much interest in England. I heard that
the dragoons were much disgusted at being forced to ride down
and shoot the Kafirs; who,—although they fight well,—if they
are overtaken in flight, throw themselves on the ground, and
plead for life. They are tall, fine, and powerful men, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
colour a good clear brown. I have heard it asserted that the
Kafirs never eat salt; if it be true, it is a most remarkable
singularity. The only garment worn by them is the kaross:
for one made of the skin of the wild-cat, consisting of fourteen
skins, they demand in Cape Town three pounds fifteen shillings;
for one of the skin of the red jackal, containing sixteen skins,
and very large, four pounds. A riding-whip of the rhinoceros or
hippopotamus hide, called a <i>sjambok</i>, costs three shillings and
sixpence, which, considering that the price on the frontier is fourpence
halfpenny, is a tolerably good per centage. At least, this
is the price demanded from Indians, who appear to be the
natural prey of the people at the Cape, who are leagued together
to pluck the Hindūs. There is one price for the English,
one for the Dutch, and one for the Africanders.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp58" id="plate40" style="max-width: 34.375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A KAFFIR WARRIOR.</p>
  <p class="right">On Stone by ‎‏فاني پارکس‏‎</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The manner in which the skins of the red jackals are prepared
by the Kafirs is remarkable; the skin, which is originally
very thick and coarse, is rubbed down with a stone until it
becomes very thin, soft, and delicate; and the way in which the
skins are sewed together to form the kaross or mantle is excellent,
the workmanship is so neat and so good. The Kafir wears the fur
of this garment next to his own skin during the winter, and in the
summer he wears the fur outside for the sake of coolness.</p>

<p>The corassa nut, or vegetable ivory, is unknown in Cape
Town. In London they told me it was brought from America,
and also from the Cape; I took a specimen with me and showed
it to the people, but found it was utterly unknown there.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Very cold, rainy, and windy weather,—the middle of
the Cape winter—thermometer 53°,—very sharp and bitter, after
heavy rains for some days; rheumatic and nervous complaints
prevalent.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Collected shells off the second lighthouse at Green
Point; sea eggs, of all colours and most brilliant tints, were in
large quantities; the waves beat beautifully over the rocks, and
the shore was delightful.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Very much warmer weather, quite the heat of an
Indian hot wind,—by far too hot to venture out in the sun.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—What can be more suddenly changeable than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
weather at the Cape? yesterday a burning sun, to-day a south-east
wind covering the mountain with a shroud, the wind
howling and roaring round the house, a heavy gale blowing, and
the street filled every minute with blinding clouds of dust and
fine stones, that, whirling up, cut against your face, as with shut
eyes you strive to make your way. The houses are thinly built,
unfitted for the climate; the chimneys smoke, and nothing can
be more disagreeable than a residence here at present. The ships
in the harbour had need look well to their anchors, to prevent
their being driven out to sea in such a fierce gale.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—A quiet day, after a south-easter that has blown for
three days.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 28th.</i>—Went to the races, which took place by the lighthouse
at Green Point. Having heard a great deal respecting the
beauty of the Dutch girls, I was induced to go to the race-ball
to see them, and was much disappointed in my expectations.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 7th.</i>—We quitted Cape Town, and went to reside at
Newlands. This place was formerly the residence of Lord Charles
Somerset, the Governor of the Cape: the house is situated in
the midst of fine woods, and noble avenues of oak; the roses
and geraniums are most luxuriant. The Table Mountain, seen
through the avenues at the back of the house, is calm and
beautiful: the view in front extends across fine woods, terminated
by the Blueberg Mountains. This is a delightful place,—the
avenues offer perpetual shade, and the flowers are a luxury.
Newlands is well situated as a residence; the walks around are
numerous and beautiful,—I enjoyed those especially around the
back of the Table Mountain, where there are a profusion of wild
flowers. On the road to Paradise the view of the opposite
mountains and Simon’s Bay to the right is very interesting;
there is still a garden at Paradise, but the house is in
ruins.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—The rides are most agreeable; how happy I am to be
on horseback again! I look with regret on the months I lost
by spending them in Cape Town, shut up in Roeland-street; it
is so delicious in the country,—we are about six or seven miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
from the town, an agreeable distance. Bought two handsome
Cape riding horses; they carried me pleasantly at times, but
were both very timid; they tell me timidity is the general fault
of the horses at the Cape,—it was absurd the trouble these
horses gave ere you could induce them to pass a flock of sheep.
They would make a handsome pair for a carriage, and would sell
well as such in Calcutta, besides paying their passage.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 26th.</i>—Drove to Wynberg; saw an arum in Mrs. Usher’s
garden that I thought remarkable. On the large bright green
leaf were white transparent marks; the length of the flower
thirty inches, the breadth eight inches; the inside of the flower
was of a deep, beautiful, and rich claret colour. How profuse
of beauty is nature to the flowers at the Cape! There was also
an aloe at the same place of such enormous size, it was quite a
sight,—a gigantic plant. I regret very much I did not sketch
or measure it; it was the finest aloe I ever beheld.</p>

<p>Never did I meet with such servants as those at the Cape,—drunkards,
thieves, and liars,—the petty annoyances these
people give are enough to destroy the pleasure of living in this
fine climate and beautiful country; had it not been for the
plague of the servants I should have felt sorrow in quitting
Africa. A Malay man-servant of ours, speaking of his family, said,
“My father was only a lieutenant, but the father of my wife’s
eldest son, he was a very great man!—he was a colonel! he gave
her the cottage. Though the son is but a boy he has so much
English spirit in him, that I am afraid of beating him; don’t you
think the other children are very like me? The friends of many
women are only captains or lieutenants; my wife’s friend was a
colonel!—we are all like this!”</p>

<p>In India, if a man is ashamed of his poor relations, the
following is applied to him: “The mule was asked, ‘Who is
your father?’ He said, ‘The horse is my maternal uncle<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.’”</p>

<p>My Malay servant had no shame at all: “There is no physic
for false ideas<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.” To have attempted to have enlightened his
mind on the subject in which he took pride, would have been as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
useless as “To pound water in a mortar<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>”—that is, it would
have been labour in vain.</p>

<p>We were supplied from Wynberg with most excellent bread,
very good mutton and poultry, vegetables, and fruits.</p>

<p><i>1844, Jan. 6th.</i>—For the last week we have had days of burning
heat—almost Indian heat, with very chilly evenings after sunset;
heavy rain has cooled the air to-day, and rendered the atmosphere
delicious. Newlands is at present the property of a Dutch
gentleman, Mr. Crugwagen.</p>

<p>The servants are very cool at the Cape; my Malay cook came
to me in Christmas week, to say she could not dress my dinner
on three days in the coming week, as she was going out to
dinner parties herself at the houses of some of her friends. I
objected to going without dinner to oblige her, and at last was
forced to dine on those days at an early hour, that she might
be off at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to her parties.</p>

<p>Two of my white muslin gowns came from the wash with the
sleeves split open, and a very deep tuck in the skirt; I found they
had been lent or hired out to an Africander, who was shorter than
myself, and had very robust arms. The people are extremely
fond of balls and gaieties, which they attend dressed out in the
gayest colours; and you sometimes see a fine French cambric
handkerchief bordered with deep lace in the black fist of a floor-scrubbing
Hottentot, as she walks grinning along to join a
dancing party. The Africanders are very dirty in their persons,
and they rub their bodies with a vile-smelling oil; the presence
of a musk-rat is quite as agreeable as that of a Hottentot in a
room. They appear to have a taste for music, judging from the
correct manner in which I have heard the children singing
various airs on the mountain.</p>

<p>I do not particularly admire the shops in Cape Town. I was
taken to a store, as they call it, and bought a quantity of Irish
linen; as soon as the linen was washed, after having been made
into jackets, it fell into holes and was useless. At a shop in the
Heerengratch I purchased two pieces of <i>mousseline-de-laine</i>; it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
quite rotten, and soon became like tinder. Perhaps the people
buy damaged goods at auction, and retail them in the shops.
Certainly, the Hindūs—as they here denominate gentlemen from
India—meet with little mercy from the <i>Capers</i> of a certain class.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—The “Robarts” having arrived, we determined to sail
in her, and came into Cape Town, to prepare for our departure;
what a contrast was the extreme heat of the town to the shade,
the quiet, the coolness of the country!</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—Having secured the stern poop cabin below and the
cabin next to it, we came on board; we were much pleased with
the ship, and more so with the captain and officers,—they were
anxious to render us every assistance, and save us all trouble and
annoyance.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—At 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a breeze sprang up, and we quitted Table
Bay. The view of the bay was beautiful, the mountains were
darkly set against a bright sky, the sun streaming between the
Lion’s Head and the Table Mount, shone with yellow and red
gleams upon the hot dust that enveloped Cape Town; the
mountains were dark and misty, the sea a deep blue, with
white-crested waves; and the houses near the water standing
out of a brilliant white. The wind was high, the sun bright, the
clouds were flying quickly, and the white sheet was beginning to
gather on the mountain.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Unpleasant weather: I cannot get over this <i>mal-de-mer</i>,
and the attendant miserable feelings.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—The native sailors celebrated the Muharram with
single-stick playing, dances, and songs; Captain Elder gave them
a fat sheep and a bag of rice to add to their repast, and awarded
prizes of gaily-coloured handkerchiefs to the best performers.
The crew were Lascars, the officers European.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 2nd.</i>—It is very rainy and most uncomfortable; the
deep sea fog creeps into every bone; long faces are in all
directions.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—A most lovely day: a fair wind, which was also cold
and bracing,—bright sunshine, good spirits, and happy looks
around us.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Since I entered the “Robarts” I have never had cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
to utter one complaint; Captain Elder is most attentive and kind
to all his passengers, and the officers follow his example. The
servants are attentive, the dinners and breakfasts excellent, and
the steward sends to any one who is inclined to remain in their
cabin all and every little luxury so acceptable to a sick person at
sea. All this is done willingly and cheerfully,—no pretext that
the articles are in the hold, no delay, and no grumbling. The
cook is excellent; he bakes the bread, which is also excellent,
and in profusion; and every plate and knife is as clean and
bright as on shore,—a good proof of a good steward, who will
allow of no neglect in those who are under his orders. After
the miserable dirtiness and half-starvation of the former vessel,
the neglect when ill, and the discomfort, I cannot sufficiently
admire the excellent regulations and order on board the
“Robarts.”</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—A calm. A native jumped overboard, and caught an
albatross that was feeding on some pork; the boat was lowered,
and the passengers shot five fine albatross that were in large
numbers round the vessel.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Passed near the islands of Amsterdam and St. Paul’s.</p>

<h3>THE SOUTHERN CROSS.</h3>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Lat. S. 35° 54′, long. E. 79° 28′. I was called on deck at
10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to witness an extraordinary appearance at the rising of the
moon: it was very dark,—a heavy black cloud spread along the
horizon, in the midst of which the half-moon on the edge of the
sea shone forth of an ominous dark red colour in the fog, and
was reflected on the waves. One solitary bird alone broke the
darkness of the sea. Above, in the deep blue sky, the Southern
Cross shone in beauty; the Pointers in Centaurus were brilliant,
and the black Magellan cloud was distinctly visible between the
stars in the Cross, looking like a hollow in the sky. Alluding to
the Cross of the South:—“Una croce maravigliosa, e di tanta
bellezza,” says Andrea Corsali, a Florentine, writing to Giuliano
Medicis, in 1515, “che non mi pare ad alcuno segno celeste
doverla comparare. E sío non mi inganno credo che sia questo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
il crusero di che Dante parlò nel principio del Purgatorio <i>con

<p>It is still sacred in the eyes of the Spaniards: “Un sentiment

rapelle ce signe de la foi planté par leurs ancêstres dans les
déserts du nouveau monde.”</p>

<p>A lantern was held for me by the chief officer while I took
the sketch, to enable me, as he said, to see the stars.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—The thermometer 81° in my cabin, and 84° in the
stern cabin above. The new moon was most beautiful. Venus
looked of surprising size, and threw her light across the sea like
a moon light.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—The trade wind blows calmly and sweetly; we only
make about 100 knots a day, and the heat is oppressive; but
the starry nights are brilliant, and the air at that time is most
luxuriously cool, fresh, and soft.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Thermometer 82°—A calm—the boats were lowered,
and a purse made for a boat race for the native crew, which
afforded amusement—the heat at night was intense.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Calm again—how much patience is requisite during a
voyage at sea!</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—A dead calm—the heat excessive, quite overpowering,
far beyond the heat of India. Heavy rain, a waterspout seen—a
little breeze in the evening—re-crossed the line during the
night.</p>

<p><i>March 1st.</i>—The heat renders all exertion, mental or bodily,
almost impossible. A heavy squall at noon, with powerful
thunder and lightning followed by a calm. No sooner are we
refreshed by a breeze, than torrents of rain fall and the calm
returns. When shall we pick up the monsoon?—we creep
along at a weary pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span></p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—The evening brought the north-east monsoon; it blew
very gently, the air was soft and sweet, and the ship in perfect
quietude moved beneath the soft moonlight; it was one of those
delicious evenings peculiar to the trade winds.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Almost perfectly calm—the boat was lowered, and a blue
shark was caught; it measured nine feet and a half,—a most
ferocious-looking beast. This shark was most curiously caught
in a noose by the third mate. The captain had a bait over the
boat, of which the shark was shy; but seeing the naked arms of
the mate in the water, he darted towards him and was caught in
the noose he had laid for him. After the sailors had dined, a man
of the name of Stewart having had too much grog, went in the
boat to catch another shark with the third officer and some
cadets. The shark took the bait, Stewart gave him a pull
towards the boat, the beast gave a spring, Stewart renewed his
pull, and into the bows of the boat plunged the shark headlong.
The cadets had fired four balls into him, which was
fortunate, the creature was rather stunned, but Stewart held
him, with the hook in one hand, the fingers of the other hand
in his eye, and the body of the fish between his legs! In this
fearful position the drunken man and the fish struggled together,
the man calling out, “Poor creature, don’t hurt him!” however,
in spite of his outcry, the mate chopped off the tail of the shark,
which disabled him, after which they pitched him out of the
boat and towed him to the ship: he measured six feet. Several
sucking fish fell off the shark into the boat: this scene I saw
from my port, the boat was but a stone’s throw from the ship.
Thermometer 86°—not a breath of air, and a dead calm—a
lovely moonlight, and we were cheered at night by the freshening
of the monsoon.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Anchored off Madras about 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>—On approaching
Madras, a range of low hills are first seen, the land lies very
low; after a time the town appears at a distance. On the left
the church in the fort is visible, the signal staff and the old
lighthouse, beyond which is the new lighthouse, and in front of
the latter is the evening drive on the beach. A post-office
Masulla boat, with her flag flying, was coming off to the ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
for the letter bags. The sea was as calm as possible; hundreds
of <i>katmirams</i>, or as they are usually called catamarans, were in
every direction out fishing. The appearance was most singular;
the catamarans sunk in the water were invisible from a distance,
and the natives on them appeared to be standing or sitting on the
sea—reminding me of the mahout as he appeared when swimming
his elephant in the Ganges, standing erect on his back,
and guiding him by the strings in his ears.</p>

<p>Some of the catamarans contained only one man, some
two; their dark bodies were almost perfectly naked, and
their heads adorned by a white or red cloth bound around
them.</p>

<p>Three or four rough logs lashed together is all that forms a
catamaran: in some a few bits of wood fastened in front form
a low bow—very original and simple concerns. Sometimes
these singular contrivances carry a triangular sail stuck on a
pole. Very good models of Masulla boats and catamarans are
to be purchased on the shore at Madras. The Masulla boat is
a large high unwieldy boat consisting of thin planks sewed together
with cocoa-nut fibres, and the seams filled up inside with
the same: they offer little resistance when run on shore through
the surf. The crew consists of twelve men. Rafts are employed
to bring off carriages to vessels. The accommodation boat,
a superior sort of Masulla boat, is fitted up with seats in the
stern, and an awning to protect passengers from the surf when
landing, as well as from the sun. The crew do not encumber
themselves with too much attire; their dresses are generally
white, ornamented with some gaily-coloured edging, a vandyke
of red or blue. The boats are unsightly, awkward concerns,
standing high and clumsily out of the water.</p>

<p>The half-revolving light of the new lighthouse is splendid,
flashing and twinkling, appearing in great brilliancy, and then
dying away to a speck, then bursting forth again in all its
radiance. A light no mariner could mistake.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—A number of boats are alongside with curiosities for
sale; the deck is covered with a marvellous collection of extraordinary
things, shells, monkeys, parroquets, and ill-stuffed fishes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
and there is a great noise created from landing horses and discharging
cargo.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Our friend Mr. R⸺ came in an accommodation boat
to take us on shore. The day was quite calm, but the surf, even
little as there was of it, was surprising to a stranger; nothing
would form a better subject for a picture than landing in the
surf at Madras. The Masulla boat went bumping on shore,
and her side having been hauled to the beach, the passengers
were put into chairs, and landed by the men. The drives are
good, and there is much open space around Madras. At the
end of three miles, we reached our destination—most glad was
I to be out of the ship! The house appeared to rock for some
hours after our arrival, which was singular, as the ship we had
quitted was perfectly still, and at anchor. Here we enjoyed the
luxury of fish, cucumbers, and fresh butter. At Madras they
appear only to use the pankha at the time of meals. The fresh
sea breeze comes in most agreeably, nevertheless, a pankha
constantly going would be very acceptable.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—The evening drive round the island, as it is called,
and along the sea-shore, is pleasant; the fine cool sea breeze
carries off all the languor produced by the heat of the day. The
statue of Sir Thomas Munro, on the Mount road, in the island,
is a handsome object: the roads are never watered at Madras,
and the carriages appear inferior to those in Calcutta.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—Visited the Mint, and was much interested in the
process of coining and assaying. We quitted our friends after
sunset, and were taken in a Masulla boat very cleverly through
the three ranges of surf, perfectly unwetted, to the “Robarts.”
The days are very hot, the evenings cool and delicious: to-night
there is not a ripple on the sea.</p>

<p>The fresh sea breeze blowing in upon me made me sleep
delightfully, and I was free from the annoyance of musquitoes,
whose bites worried me on shore. When we reach Calcutta,
how much we shall miss the evening breeze from the sea, which
is so delightful at Madras!</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Sunday,—crowds of natives on board, Sunday being
the great day of business with them: they brought grapes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
which were delicious. I purchased a saw-fish, a sting-ray, or
bat-fish, a sea-porcupine, a halfmoon-fish, and some others.</p>

<p>“Mem want some she-asses?” “What?” “She-asses,
Mem; many got, Mem buy, I bring she-asses.” They turned out
to be sea-horses, which appear to be abundant at Madras, as
well as all sorts of monstrous and queer fish. A juggler on
board was displaying some of his tricks. He finished by sitting
down on the deck, when he passed the blade of a sword down
his throat, as far as the hilt, and during the time the blade was
in his body, he let off fireworks, which were on the four corners
of two pieces of wood that were fixed in the form of a cross on
the hilt of the sword, and which spun round upon it. It was a
disgusting sight, and an unpleasant one, as it sometimes causes
the death of the juggler. Some of the passengers, on their
return to the “Robarts,” complained much of the heat, and of
the musquitoes on shore, also of the badness of the inns, which
are not sufficiently good to aspire to the name of hotels. The
<i>daunās</i> or donies, as we call them, are numerous at Madras;
they are country vessels, coasters, and traders, and are commanded
by a <i>sarhang</i>, who wears the <i>undress</i> of the katmiram
men; the crews are native—the vessels are short, thick, clumsy,
and marvellously ugly.</p>

<p>It is interesting to trace the descendants of Milton; his
grandson was parish-clerk of Fort St. George, at a very remote
period. Milton’s youngest and favourite daughter Deborah
married a Mr. Clarke; she is said to have been a woman of
cultivated understanding, and not unpleasing manners; known
to Richardson and patronized by Addison, who procured a permanent
provision for her from Queen Caroline. Her only son
Caleb Clarke went to Madras in the first years of the eighteenth
century, and it appears from an examination of the Parish
Register of Fort St. George that he was parish-clerk there from
1717 to 1719, and was buried there on the 26th of October of
the latter year.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Captain Elder, finding the wind would not answer
for getting out beyond the shipping, turned the head of the
“Robarts” in shore, and cut through a crowd of donies, country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
vessels, in great style. We sailed from Madras with a delightful
breeze, and were glad to resume our voyage. The captain
brought me a present of a remarkably large globe-fish, a globular
fish, covered with very sharp prickles; it has the beak of a
parrot, and is, I understand, also called the parrot-fish.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—The ship going nearly ten knots an hour, and as
steady as if she were at anchor: how I enjoy the sea breeze!
what health, strength, and spirits it gives me!</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—At sunset we passed close to Vizagapatam, the range
of distant blue mountains was very beautiful, contrasted with
the red volcanic-looking hills on the sea-shore.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Anchored off Pooree: the view of the station from the
sea is remarkable: on the left the temple of Jaganāth stands a
high and conspicuous object. The houses are built along the
shore on the sands, and close to the beach, where the surf rolls
for ever with great violence. It is a beautiful sight to watch a
Masulla boat rising and sinking as she comes over and through
the surfs, of which there appear to be three regular ranges, and
which roll with greater violence than the surf at Madras. Few
vessels ever anchor at Pooree. I think they told me a ship had
not been there for three years. The “Robarts” anchored there
to land Colonel and Mrs. G⸺; they went on shore in a
Masulla boat, their carriage and horses were landed on a raft.</p>

<h3>THE TEMPLE OF JAGANĀTH.</h3>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Mr. S⸺ came off to the “Robarts,” and we returned
with him in the Masulla boat to his house, where we
breakfasted and enjoyed fresh strawberries. The sun was
extremely powerful, but I could not resist going in a palanquin
to see the temple of Jaganāth. It is built of stone, and surrounded
by a very high wall of the same material, enclosing a
large space of ground, and it has four great gateways. In front
of the grand entrance is a column of one entire piece of stone,
and elegant in form. Two monsters frown on either side the
gateway. A wheel ornaments the top of the dome, surmounted
by a staff, on which three flags are flying; the staff was bent
during a hurricane. I got out of the palanquin, and went into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
the gateway to look at the temple; the Brahmans were extremely
afraid my unholy footstep might profane the place, and
would scarcely allow me even to look into the interior, otherwise
I would have sketched it. A number of those idle rascals were
about, and they appeared annoyed when I expressed a wish to
enter the enclosure, which is around the temple.</p>

<p>One of the Hindoo poets, in answer to the question, “Why
has Vishnŭ assumed a wooden shape?” (alluding to the image
of Jaganāth) says, “The troubles of his family have turned
Vishnŭ into wood: in the first place he has two wives, one of
whom (the goddess of Learning) is constantly talking, and the
other (the goddess of Prosperity) never remains in one place:
to increase his troubles, he sits on a snake; his dwelling is in
the water, and he rides on a bird. All the Hindoos acknowledge
it is a great misfortune for a man to have two wives;
especially if both live in one house.”</p>

<p>Krishnŭ is a descent of Vishnŭ, and the bones of Krishnŭ
are Jŭgŭnat’hŭ.</p>

<p>I made the circuit of the wall, and then visited the swing of
the idol. Once a year Jaganāth is brought forth, and put into
this swing. The arch is of black marble, and has the appearance
of richly-carved bronze: the ropes are supported by iron
rings fixed into the arch. It stands on a platform, to which
you ascend by a flight of steps, which are crowned by two
monsters, <i>couchant</i>. From the temple I returned to tiffin, and
on my way I thought of the description of the plains covered
with human sculls; therefore, I kept a sharp look out for them,
but not one could I see. The god was shut up in his temple;
we were not fortunate enough to land there during the celebration
of the rites, or when he is brought forth once a year at the
festival called <i>Rat’-ha-jattra</i>, or the festival of the Chariot. The
height of the <i>ruth</i> is forty-two feet, supported on sixteen wheels;
the four horses in front of it are of wood: ropes are attached to
the bars below, and the car, with the monstrous idol within it,
is drawn by 20,000 frantic devotees. On this occasion Krishnŭ
is worshipped as Jaganāth’ha, or Lord of the universe: the Lord
of the World, from <i>jugŭt</i>, the world, and <i>nat’hu</i>, lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span></p>

<p>“In some period of Hindū history he was accidentally killed
by a hunter, who left the body to rot under the tree where it
fell. Some pious person, however, collected the bones of
Krishnŭ, and placed them in a box, where they remained: a
king, who was performing religious austerities, to obtain some
favour of Vishnŭ, was directed by the latter to form the image
of Jŭgŭnnathŭ, and put into its belly these bones of Krishnŭ,
by which means he should obtain the fruit of his religious
austerities. The king inquired who should make this image;
and was commanded to pray to Vishnŭ-kŭrmŭ the architect of
the gods. He did so, and obtained his request; but the architect
at the same time declared, that if any one disturbed him
while preparing the image, he would leave it in an unfinished
state. He then began, and in one night built a temple upon
the blue mountain in Orissa, and proceeded to prepare the
image in the temple; but the impatient king, after waiting
fifteen days, went to the spot; on which the architect of the
gods desisted from his work, and left the god without feet or
hands. The king was very much disconcerted; but on praying
to Brŭmha, he promised to make the image famous in its present
shape. The king now invited all the gods to be present at
the setting up of this image: Brŭmha himself acted as high
priest, and gave eyes and a soul to the god, which completely
established the fame of Jŭgŭnnathŭ. This image is said to lie
in a pool near the present temple of Jŭgŭnnathŭ in Orissa.”
After many ceremonies have been performed within the temple,
the god is drawn forth in his car; at the expiration of eight days
he is conveyed back to the place from which he came. The
festival is intended to celebrate the diversions of Krishnŭ and
the Gopīs, with whom he used to ride out in his chariot. The
image of Bŭlŭ-Ramŭ the brother of Jŭgŭnnat’hŭ almost always
accompanies him. Some place the image of Révŭtee by the
side of her husband, Bŭlŭ-Ramŭ; she was a singular personage,
that maiden lady, for at the time of her marriage she was
3,888,000 years old! Bŭlŭ-Ramŭ saw her for the first time
when ploughing; notwithstanding her immense stature (which
reached as high as a sound ascends in clapping the hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
seven times), Bŭlŭ-Ramŭ married her, and to bring down
her monstrous height, he fastened a ploughshare to her
shoulders.</p>

<h3>JAGANĀTH.</h3>

<p>At this festival all castes eat together: the pilgrims to this
shrine endure excessive hardships from fatigue, want of food,
and exposure to the weather; sometimes a devotee will throw
himself under the wheels of the car, and be crushed to death,
believing, if he sacrificed his life through his faith in Jŭgŭnat’hŭ,
the god would certainly save him. Every third year they make
a new image, when a Brahman removes the original bones of
Krishnŭ from the inside of the old image to that of the new
one; on this occasion he covers his eyes, lest he should be
struck dead for looking on such sacred relics. The Rajah of
Burdwan expended twelve lākh of rupees in a journey to
Jŭgŭnat’hŭ, including two lākh paid as a bribe to the Brahmans
to permit him to see these bones; but he died six months afterwards
for his temerity. A number of women belong to the
temple, whose employment is to dance and sing before the god.
Jŭgŭnat’hŭ, his brother, Bŭlŭ-Ramŭ, and their sister, Soobhŭdra,
are placed together in the car.</p>

<p>In the plate entitled <a href="#plate42">Jaganāth</a> is a brass idol, (Fig. 5,) which
was given me at Pooree; it may probably represent the three
personages above mentioned; but why the brother and sister
should have stumps instead of arms, and why they should have
no legs, I cannot imagine. Is Jaganāth in himself a trinity, as
this idol would lead one to suppose?</p>

<p>Fig. 1, in the same plate, is a fac-simile of a little wooden model
of the god; it has no legs, and only stumps as arms; the head is
very large, as are also the great circular eyes. At the festivals
the Brahmans adorn Jaganāth with silver or golden hands; and
an offering of a pair of golden hands to the image is considered
an act of great devotion. This model was presented to me at
Pooree, as was also the seal (Fig. 2), with which the priests
stamp the worshipper on the breast and on the arms; it is
covered with various holy emblems: the <i>tika</i> of <i>bhabūt</i> or ashes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
is also placed on the forehead of the pilgrim by the ministering
Brahman. The <i>Uchchat tilak</i> is the ceremony of putting a few
grains of boiled rice on the forehead of an image when addressed,
or of a Brahman when invited to an entertainment.</p>

<p>The āsan, the sacred mat, used by the Hindūs in worship, is
made of the <i>kashŭ</i> grass (saccharum spontaneum), and sold at

<p>I saw a small model of the <i>ruth</i>, or car, which was ornamented
with flags and red linen. At Allahabad I wished to inspect
one which was passing along the road, but was deterred from
so doing, being told it was covered with indelicate paintings.</p>

<p>During the melā, or great fair, at the sacred junction of the
rivers at Allahabad, I have often seen worship performed before
an image of Jaganāth, as described <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_262">Vol. I. page 262</a>.</p>

<p>A carved stone was presented to me, brought from the ruins
of a city of great extent, about forty miles from Pooree; its
name has escaped my memory, but it appeared from the account
I received to be full of curiosities; few persons, however, had
ventured to visit the ruined city, deterred by the probability of
taking a fever, in consequence of the malaria produced by the
thick jangal by which it is surrounded. The stone is white, and
upon it is carved the figure of some remarkable personage, above
which is an emblem of Mahadēo. A very fine tiger’s skin was
also added to my collection. I carried off my prizes with great
delight, and they now adorn my museum.</p>

<p>In the evening our party returned on board in a Masulla boat
through a very fine surf that flung the boat right on end, and
carried her back many times towards the beach ere we could
make our way through it; the foam dashed over the boat as
every surf rolled upon her; it was a beautiful sight,—I enjoyed
extremely the passing through those magnificent surfs. The
countenance of the captain of the “Robarts,” who was with us,
was grave and anxious; he eyed the horizon intently, and
appeared not to like the look of the sky. He weighed anchor
instantly on reaching the ship, and said to me afterwards, “I
did not like the appearance of the weather as we came on board,
and was thinking whether I should lay my bones there.” With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
a wind on shore a ship off Pooree must be in an awkward
position.</p>

<p><i>27th</i>.—At 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> arrived off the floating light, a brig, anchored
at the Sandheads; it was a beautiful night,—our signal-lights
burnt brightly, and we were guided from time to time as we
approached the vessel by the half-hour lights burnt on board
her; the last light we had seen had been pretty distant, and
steering by it, we suddenly perceived the brig on our quarter,
about one hundred yards off,—her sails, masts, cordage, and
hull glancing out in the darkness, and from the deep shadow,
by the lurid glare of her blue light; the sight was beautifully
spectral. A pilot came immediately on board; with a fine
breeze and a press of sail we proceeded towards Saugor,
anchored, and reported our arrival at the Sandheads.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—A fine breeze bore us on until we anchored off the
Bishop’s Palace, at which time a north-wester came on, accompanied
by thunder, lightning, and heavy rain.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Arrived off Baboo Ghāt, Calcutta, after a most agreeable
voyage from the Cape, which, I believe, was enjoyed by
every one on board.</p>

<p>The “Robarts” was a fine vessel, one of the old teak Indiamen.
With regret we saw the following extract in a newspaper
in 1847:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Wilful burning of an Indiaman.</i></p>

<p>“Considerable surprise has within the last day or two existed
in the underwriters’ room at Lloyd’s, in consequence of the
receipt of intelligence of the loss of another East India trader
by fire, under circumstances that have justified the officers
under whose command she was placed in apprehending the
greater part of the crew on a charge of having maliciously
occasioned the destruction of the ship. She was the ‘Robarts,’
of London, part the property of Messrs. Havisides and Co., of
Cornhill, and was one of the old-fashioned teak-built Indiamen,
of nearly 1,000 tons’ burden. She was deeply laden with cotton
and other merchandize, which had been shipped at Calcutta, as
well as a number of passengers, and was on the point of sailing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
when the calamity happened. The immense losses by fire that
merchants and shipowners have within the last two years sustained
in that port—for we believe no fewer than five large ships
have been totally destroyed during that time—have led to every
precaution on their part. The cargo of the ‘Robarts’ underwent
a strict scrutiny before it was taken on board, and the
ship’s hold was carefully overhauled, besides which extra
lookers-on were appointed to watch the conduct of the crew.
With the exception of the officers, the crew were composed of
Lascars, nearly seventy in number; and here it is proper to
mention, that in all instances where they are engaged to navigate
a vessel, whether to England or elsewhere, they are entitled
by the laws of that country to six months’ pay in advance.
This has led to the disasters spoken of; the Lascars firing
the ships to defraud the owners of their services, all the
ships being destroyed a night or so before the day of their
appointed sailing. The ‘Robarts’ dropped down the river on
the 28th of June, and the passengers having come on board she
sailed on the following day, the 29th, for China. The succeeding
night saw the destruction of the vessel in the river. The
passengers and most of the officers were buried in slumber
when they were startled by the cries of ‘fire,’ and on their
reaching the deck were not a little alarmed at finding such
to be the case, for smoke was rolling up in dense volumes
from the fore part of the vessel. The captain and chief officer
went down to ascertain its locality, and finding the bulk of the
fire apparently behind the starboard-chain box, or locker, water
in copious quantities was immediately thrown down, the pumps
being also got to work; notwithstanding, however, no effect
was produced, but the smoke and heat increased, and the
stench clearly showed the fire had extended to the cotton in
the hold. The exertions were continued, but at four o’clock,
four hours after the alarm was raised, Captain Elder seeing
there was not the least chance of saving the ship, ordered the
boats to be lowered, and having seen all hands and the passengers
safe in them abandoned her to her fate. Fortunately
for them another vessel, named the ‘Fatima,’ was coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
down the channel, and took them on board to Kedgeree, where
they were landed. It is unnecessary to observe that in a few
hours the ‘Robarts’ was totally destroyed. The men who
were charged with setting fire to the ship have undergone an
examination, and are remanded. The result of the second
day’s examination has not yet been received. The loss of the
vessel and cargo is said to exceed £30,000. It is covered by
insurances.”—<i>Observer.</i></p>

<p><i>1844, April 1st.</i>—We took a house in Chowringhee, and found
soon after that the cholera and small-pox were prevalent in
Calcutta: how ill the dampness and the heat of this Bengal
climate render me!—they destroy all energy. Calcutta is famous
for its <i>tapsi machhī</i> (mango fish), in this month they are in
perfection. “Mangoes and fish meet of necessity<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>;” they come
in at the same season, and the unripe mango is also used in
cooking fish: the dāndīs bring them in small baskets fresh from
the boats to the Course of an evening, and sell them twenty for
a rupee, at the time a khansaman charges his master one rupee
for five of them. Parties are made, to Fulta and Budge-Budge,
down the river, to eat mango fish,—after the fashion of white-bait
parties in town; they are excellent—smoked in the same
manner as anwarī fish—for breakfast.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—A fine fall of rain,—perhaps it will clear the air, and
drive off the cholera, which is raging strongly at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span></p>

<p><i>May 24th.</i>—Mango fish fifty per rupee. The weather very
hot, the nights most oppressive, from the heavy mist and great
heat. We left our horses at the Cape, which we regretted on
our arrival in Calcutta; we have been looking out for a pair of
carriage horses for some time. This is the cheapest season of
the year in which to make the purchase, but they are very dear;
those for sale at eight hundred rupees are vile, those at one
thousand indifferent,—you cannot get a good pair under
fourteen or sixteen hundred rupees; it would not answer to
bring riding horses from the Cape for sale, but carriage horses
would answer well, they are in such great demand in Calcutta.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Rain having fallen on the Queen’s birthday, the display
of fireworks was postponed until to-day; it was a failure, with
the exception of one bouquet, which was good. They would
not bear a comparison with the <i>jeux d’artifices</i> that I witnessed
in Paris on the day of the King’s fête; I never saw any colours
that equalled those in brilliancy and variety. The last firework,
a bouquet of rockets of divers colours, was superb; and sometimes
a composition was burnt, that threw a red glare over the
landscape; then came a glare of blue lights, casting a spectral
appearance on the houses, the river, and the sky, after which
another tint was thrown forth, and the effect was excellent.</p>

<p><i>June 16th.</i>—Lord Ellenborough recalled,—deposed by the
Court of Directors.</p>

<p><i>July 18th.</i>—Visited the livery stables to see some fresh Arabs,
among which some very good ones were pointed out to me.
There was not a horse that I would have selected for my own
riding whose price was less than from twelve to sixteen hundred
rupees; and for those likely to turn out good racers they asked
two and three thousand.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Lord Ellenborough quitted Calcutta, and returned to
England.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 22nd.</i>—A very heavy gale, and a deep fall of rain; the
next day the natives were catching fish all over the maidān in
front of the Government House; they say the fish fell with the
rain, which is now a foot deep on the ground.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 1st.</i>—It being our intention to proceed by the river to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
Allahabad, and the weather becoming daily cooler, we hired a
pinnace budgerow for ourselves, a large <i>olāk</i> for the baggage,
and a cook-boat, sent them to Prinsep’s Ghāt, and prepared for
the voyage.</p>

<p>That branch of the Ganges that quits the main stream at
Gopalgunj, flowing by Sooty to Moorshedabad, is called the
Bhagirathī until it reaches Nuddea, at which place it is joined
by the Jellinghy, and they flow on, passing Calcutta, to the
island of Sāgor, under the name of the Hoogly. Only that
part of the Ganges which lies in a line from Gangoutrī to Sāgor
island is considered holy by the Hindūs, and named the Ganga
or Bhagirathī. The Hoogly river, therefore, of Europeans, is
considered as the true Ganges.</p>

<p>The Bore commences at Hoogly Point, Sāgor, where the
river first contracts itself, and is perceptible above the town of
Hoogly: so quick is its motion, that it scarcely employs four
hours in running up from the one to the other, although the
distance is nearly seventy miles. It does not run on the
Calcutta side, but along the opposite bank; whence it crosses at
Chitpūr, about four miles above Fort William, and proceeds
with great violence. On its approach boats must immediately
quit the shore, and go for safety into the middle of the river;
at Calcutta it sometimes occasions an instantaneous rise of five
feet. The tide is perceptible as far as Nuddea.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Quitted Calcutta with a foul wind and heavy rain,—damp,
gloomy, and rheumatic weather.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—Started with a fair wind, bought two milch goats for
thirteen rupees eight ānās,—a great prize on the river. Moored
the vessels at Ishapūr, in order to visit a friend who has charge
of the powder-works at that place; his house, which is large
and excellent, is situated on the banks of the river; every thing
is so cool and fresh around it; it is delightful to be in the
country once more.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—The fast of the Muharram ended to-day; the followers
of the prophet amongst our servants, wishing to have a great
feast, petitioned to be allowed to stay till noon, to worship and to
stuff pillāo. Quitted Hoogly with the tide at half-past one <span class="allsmcap">P.M.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span></span></p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—Passed the village of Chagdah, on the left bank of the
Matabangah, forty-six miles from Calcutta; a village of <i>corpses</i>,—the
inhabitants of which, having been brought by their
relatives to the river’s side, to die before their time, prefer a
debased existence to a righteous end, agreeing therein with the
highest authorities. Pope’s Homer makes Achilles in the
Elysian fields say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rather I’d choose laboriously to bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A weight of woes, and breathe the vital air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than reign the scepter’d monarch of the dead.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Solomon deems it better to be a live dog than a dead lion; and
Job, called by Byron “the Respectable,” says, “Why should
a living man complain?” to which Byron adds, “For no reason
that I can see, except that a dead man cannot.” In the face
of these grave authorities, as far as I am concerned, I cannot
help being of a different opinion: the proverb agrees with my
view of the subject,—“It is better to die with honour than live
with infamy<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.” These unfortunate people, outcasts from their
homes and families, on account of their unexpected recovery,
after having been exposed by their relatives to die on the banks
of the river, have taken refuge in this village, and are its sole
inhabitants.</p>

<p>“The Hindūs are extremely anxious to die in sight of the
Ganges, that their sins may be washed away in their last
moments. A person in his last agonies is frequently dragged from
his bed and friends, and carried, in the coldest or in the hottest
weather, from whatever distance, to the river-side, where he
lies, if a poor man, without a covering day and night, until he
expires. With the pains of death upon him, he is placed up to
the middle in water, and drenched with it; leaves of the toolsee
plant are also put into his mouth, and his relations call upon
him to repeat, and repeat for him, the names of Ramŭ, Hŭree,
Narayŭnŭ, Brŭmha, Gŭnga, &amp;c. In some cases the family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
priest repeats some incantations, and makes an offering to
Voitŭrŭnēē, the river over which the soul, they say, is ferried after
leaving the body. The relations of the dying man spread the
sediment of the river on his forehead or breast, and afterwards,
with the finger, write on this sediment the name of some deity.
If a person should die in his house, and not by the river-side,
it is considered as a great misfortune, as he thereby loses the
help of the goddess in his dying moments. If a person choose
to die at home, his memory becomes infamous.”</p>

<p>This part of the river is flat and uninteresting; anchored a
little below Culna, which is sixty-six miles by water, fifty-two
by land, from Calcutta. At night the insects, attracted by the
brilliant light of the Silvant lamps, came into the cabin in swarms—like
the plagues of Egypt they fall into the wine-cups and fill
the plates; they are over my hands, and over the paper on
which I am writing, and are a complete pest.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—Very hot during the middle of the day; thermometer
86°. Passed the Dhobah sugar-works, seventy-two miles by
water from Calcutta; left the Jellingee river on the right, and
anchored at Nuddea, eighty-three by water, and sixty-four by
land. The steamers generally arrive at the Dhobah sugar-works
in one day, but still we think we have come on quickly in
the Budgerow! We did not land to visit the long range of
temples on the bank of the river. To this place the Calcutta
Sircars come, to <i>eat the air</i>.</p>

<p>At Meertulla, half-way between Nuddea and Dumdumma, we
crossed the Tropic of Cancer, which made us fancy ourselves in
a cooler climate, in spite of the extreme heat. At noon-day it
is almost intolerable, and very oppressive, but the early mornings
are cool, and the nights also; moored off Dumdumma.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Lugāoed on a dry sandbank beyond Dewangunge,
one hundred and eighteen miles from Calcutta; it has a large
mart, and a fine indigo factory.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Arrived early in the day off Cutwa, situated on the
right bank of the Bhagirathī, five miles from Dewangunge;
anchored to procure fowls, fish, and vegetables; it has a coal
depôt for steamers. Cutwa is on the Adgar-nālā: found nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
in the bazār but eggs and plantains, fowls and <i>byguns</i> (solanum
melongena). Purchased twelve sticks of <i>shola</i>, or <i>sola</i>, as it is
commonly called, for one <i>paisā</i>; the dāndīs use it as a tinder-box,
and strike fire into the end of a sola stick with a flint and
steel. A cooler day; the river very uninteresting; moored on a
nameless sandbank.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—Passed the Field of Plassey, sixteen miles above
Cutwa, on the left bank; memorable for the defeat of Suraja
Dowla, by the British forces under Colonel Clive, June 23rd,
1757. This battle decided the fate of Bengal, and ultimately
of India. Anchored on a fine cool sandbank near the Company’s
<i>fīl-khāna</i> (elephant establishment), on the left bank, eight miles
above Plassey.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Arrived at Rangamattī, a village on the right bank,
with steep red banks; the Company’s silk manufactories were
here formerly. The place is celebrated for <i>sajjī-mattī</i>, or fuller’s
earth: it is six miles from Berhampūr, one hundred and sixty
from Calcutta, and seventy-seven from Jellingee. Lugāoed at
the civil station of Berhampūr, which looks quite deserted;
nothing is going forward; no crowds of natives on the bank
with various articles for sale, and no picturesque boats on the
river.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Sent letters to the Dāk—laid in a store of fowls,
bread, butter, charcoal, limes, &amp;c., to help us on to Rajmahāl,
as provisions are only to be procured at the large
stations.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Passed the palace of the Nawāb of Moorshedabad:
admired the fanciful boats he uses on state occasions, and the
snake boats; the latter fly with great swiftness when rowed
by twenty men, from their amazing length and extreme narrowness.
The state boats are highly gilt, and ornamented
very tastefully with colours and gold; they are light and airy
in the extreme. The river is very shallow; we have great difficulty
in finding the deep parts; in consequence, our progress is
slow, but the scenery is very beautiful. Moored off a small
<i>bastī</i> (village) on the right bank.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—A little fleet of small boats filled with fire-wood has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
passed us; never was there any thing so neatly and regularly
stowed away as the wood. The weather is becoming sensibly
cooler and more pleasant: moored below Jungipūr on a field
covered with the <i>tūt</i>, (morus Indica, Indian mulberry,) a shrub
which is planted and cultivated in great quantities as food for
the silkworms which are reared in the neighbouring villages.
My goats luxuriated for some hours by moonlight in the fields
of tūt, enjoying the fresh shrubs; they have been cut down, and
the young sprouts are now only about a foot high.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—Passed Jungipūr; paid the toll which is levied for
keeping open the entrance of the Bhagirathī; anchored at
Kamalpūr, a straggling picturesque village: cows are here in
the greatest abundance—the village swarms with them; they
swim the cows over the river in herds to graze on the opposite
bank, and swim them back again in the evening; a couple
of men usually accompany the herd, crossing the river by holding
on to the tail of a cow: the animals take to the water as a
thing of course; on their arrival at the cottages, they are tied
up with food before them, and a smouldering fire is kept up
near them all night: the cows enveloped in the smoke are free
from the worrying of the insects. Mr. Laruletta has a large
silk manufactory at Jungipūr; he lives in the Residency, which
he purchased from the Government; it is forty-two miles above
Berhampūr. The villages of Gurka and Kidderpūr are on the
opposite bank.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Quitted the Bhagirathī and entered on the Ganges:
stopped at a place famous for bamboos, consisting of a few huts
built of mats on the river-side, where bamboos and ardent
spirits are sold. My mānjhī bought nine very large newly-cut
bamboos for one rupee five ānās, and complained of their
being very dear! Crossed the river, and anchored above the
village of Konsert, at the Luckipūr indigo factory, a most
melancholy looking place, the bungalow in ruins—the owner
resides on the opposite side of the river. There is a very fine
banyan tree on the Ghāt, at Konsert, and two very fine silk
cotton trees (bombax heptaphyllum) in front of the factory. The
<i>kajūr</i> (phœnix dactylifera, common date palm,) flourishes here,—it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
is remarkable for its lofty trunk, rugged on account of the
persistent vestiges of the decayed leaves.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Passed Dulalpūr and saw the factory of Chandnī Kotī
in the distance, where I met with so much hospitality on my
expedition to the ruins of Gaur. Heard of Mr. Sinclair’s death,
which took place about a year ago, most likely from the jungle
fever. After a pleasant sail with a fair wind, had the first sight
of the Hills; anchored on a cool, clear, and fresh sandbank in
the middle of the Ganges—the moon high, the night quiet and
agreeable. I took a camera lucida on deck, and was much
amused with the delight of the crew when they looked into it.
They called it a <i>Kompās</i>, and were very anxious to have their
own likenesses taken.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Thermometer 82° in the cabin at noon; not a breath
of air, the river very broad and shallow; it is hardly possible to
find water enough to float the budgerow. We are just passing
a steamer with a cargo flat in tow; she has grounded, and
there she is in the midst of the river burning with heat, whilst
the little pilot boats are trying to find some channel deep
enough for her. Like the hare and the tortoise in the fable,
we shall reach the goal first. Imagine the heat of the iron
steamer, the bright river giving back the sun’s rays, and looking
like unruffled glass around her; the inside of the vessel must
resemble a well-heated iron oven. Lugāoed off Husseinpūr.
The woolāk (baggage-boat) came up late; for the second time
she has run foul of the budgerow, and has done her some
damage. The mānjhī of the woolāk cannot see after sunset,
having what the natives call <i>rāt andhā</i>, or night blindness: he
can see well enough during the day time;—this is rather a disagreeable
affliction for the master of a vessel.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Passed the steamer and flat with passengers for Calcutta—very
hot and oppressive—arrived near Rajmahāl, and
found a large portion of the bank of the river had fallen in;—it
was a little land-slip. The palm-trees on the fallen land were in
most picturesque disorder. Moored off the ancient palace of
Rajmahāl: the river, which formerly washed its walls, has deserted
it, and the deep current is on the opposite side, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
an almost dry bed before the ruins. Visited the old <i>baolī</i>
(well), which is beautified by age: down the centre of it hang
long pendant shoots of the banyan, and the roots of trees:
thence I proceeded to the tombs of the Europeans, and to the
gateway. Several cows were quietly ruminating under the black
marble arches of the verandah of the palace that overlooks the
river. The steamers take in their coal a mile below, and therefore
do not destroy the beauty of the old ruins with their smoke,
and steam, and Birmingham appearance. The Hills are distant
about five miles inland. Myriads of minute insects are in great
number; they fill my nose like snuff, and get into my eyes and
ears, and torment me so much, I find it almost impossible to
write; they fill my teacup, and absolutely are giving forth a
vile odour from the numbers that have found death around the
flame of the candle.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—The early morning was delightful—the weather much
cooler and more agreeable. Laid in fresh stores—found remarkably
fine fowls and good yams—sailed at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, lugāoed at 7,
on a sandbank—here the insects are but few, and do not annoy
me as they did last night. Crocodiles abound, and are showing
themselves continually, swimming low in the water. We passed
near this place a village full of a caste of people who live on
crocodile flesh. My dāndīs say they understand it smells rank,
and is very hard. Twice this evening I heard a shrill peculiar
scream, and on remarking it to the men, they said it was the
cry of the crocodile. Twenty-one miles above Rajmahāl and
two miles below Sikrī-galī Hill and Point, says the “Calcutta
Directory,” is the beautiful Mootee Jhurna waterfall; it is
visible on the eastern side of the Hills. I neither saw nor
visited it.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Anchored at sunset at Sikrī-galī—landed and walked
to the bungalow. The French indigo planter had quitted the
place; the house was uninhabited; had he been there, he would
have exclaimed,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Voilà Madame, qui arrive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour encore visiter mes tigres!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Walked on a short distance to have a view of the Hills, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
to recall the memory of the Hill-man and his <i>terī</i> (wife): saw
some beautiful goats in the village, which the people refused to
sell, although I bribed them high. Wood and charcoal was
cheap and plentiful; nothing else was to be procured. A
number of jackals were roaming and howling in the village.
The point of Sikrī-galī is very picturesque from the river.
The indigo factor’s bungalow would be an excellent shooting
box. It is said the Jharna waterfall and the Himalaya mountains
are visible at times from Rajmahāl; I have never seen
either. Bears, tigers, rhinoceroses, leopards, hogs, deer of all
kinds, abound here, and feathered game in the Hills. Steamers
pass in ten days and a half in the dry season from Calcutta.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 1st.</i>—Quitted Sikrī-galī early; the river very rapid,
nothing but dreary sandbanks, with a distant view of the Hills.
Porpoises gambolling in plenty.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>—Fish in abundance for sale on the bank at Kantnagar;
a dreary day; anchored on a sandbank,—insects detestable,—the
thermometer at ten <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> only 70°.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—Saw a herd of buffaloes swimming the river—about one
hundred head; the men swam with them, each holding on by a
buffalo’s tail, with his clothes carried high in the air in one
hand. Some of the men had bamboos, with which they beat
and urged the animals to swim. When I first caught sight of
them I took them for a reef of low black rocks, the black heads
were so numerous and so mixed together. Late in the evening
saw the rocks of Colgong; tracked up the left bank of the river,
aided by a good breeze; the force of the stream here is excessive,
and it was a great piece of good fortune we had a fair wind to
aid us; anchored in darkness about a mile below Kuhulgaon—that
is, Colgong.</p>

<p>The “Directory” says, “Fifty-eight miles above Rajmahāl, on
the left bank of the river, is the junction of the Koosie river.
On the Nepaul part of the Himalaya, nearly opposite, is the
Patturgatta Hill, with one or two temples, and is noted in native
tradition for a cave (only a small hole), into which, it is said, a
Rajah, with an immense suite, and one lakh of torch-bearers,
entered, and never returned;—such is the story of the attending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
fakīr. Hence are beautiful views of isolated hills, and the tips
of the Colgong Rocks. The Southern or Patturgatta passage
up to Colgong has some very dangerous rocks, where, if a boat
touches, not a soul can be saved.”</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—At daybreak arose to get a view of the rocks; made
the mānjhī cross over to the Colgong side, to enable me to
take a sketch from that bank. These rocky islands are very
singular and beautiful, and there are four of them; rocks on
rocks, covered with fine foliage, they rise straight out of the
centre of the river, which runs like a mill-sluice, and is here
extremely broad; we came up the left passage, which is navigable
after the rains. They say no one lives upon these rocks;
that a fakīr formerly took up his abode there, but having been
eaten by a snake (an <i>ajgar</i>), one of enormous size, and an eater
of human flesh, the people became alarmed, and no holy or
unholy person has since taken up their residence on these rocky
islands. Here we bought two very fine rohū fish (cyprinus
denticulatus) for six ānās, but could not procure any of the
rock fish: small boats were under the rocks fishing, and snakes,
they say, abound upon them.</p>

<p>“The village of Colgong is sixty-eight miles above Calcutta,
and eighteen below Bhagulpūr; it is on the right bank of the
river, has a fine nālā and shelter for boats: it is a coal depôt
for steamers. The left passage should never be attempted by
either steamers or boats in the rains, as the currents and eddies
between the main and the rocks make it certain loss for any
native boats, and too dangerous for steamers; boats, in attempting
it, must be careful to have very strong tracking lines low down
on their prows, with plenty of trackers, and two bowlines as
guys to the bank, and he kept close in. Rock fish are procurable
here, also fowls, kids, eggs, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>I longed to have a gun fired, to awaken the echoes, and to
startle the myriads of birds that inhabit these singular rocks.
We have just passed a most enormous crocodile; it was basking
in the sun on a sandbank, looking like the stem of a dry tree,
and, but for a peculiar shine and polish, and the shade cast on
the bank, you would not have supposed it a living animal:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
some dāndīs, tracking near it, aroused the enormous beast, and
it took refuge in the river; it was one of the largest I ever saw.
Birds were around in innumerable flights. The river presents a
singular picture; the expanse of water is very great, interspersed
with low sandbanks in every direction. Three crocodiles are on
the banks,—one at full length out of the river, on the top of the
bank, the other two half out of the water, and lying flat upon it.
One of the native charpāīs, on which a corpse has been brought
down to be burned, and which, from being reckoned unclean, is
always left on the spot, is on a sandbank; it is upset, the feet in
the air, and seated inside is an enormous vulture, gorged from his
horrible feast. Storks, with their long legs and white bodies,
are numerous in the water; and some very soft-plumed birds,
looking like large doves, are on the sands; whilst countless
birds, in flocks, are flying in every direction. We anchored on
a fine open clean sandbank, and enjoyed the coolness of the
evening and the quietude around us; no human habitations
were to be seen,—nothing but the expanse of the broad river,
and its distant banks.</p>

<p><i>1844, Nov. 5th.</i>—At noon we moored off the Civil station of
Bhagulpūr. The river-side has been very picturesque the whole
distance from Colgong. Procured mutton, fowls, yams, &amp;c.,
from the bazār; and purchased some pieces of silk and some
imitation Scotch plaid, that was brought for sale to the budgerow.
Accompanied the Judge to see the new church, the building
of which he superintends; saw the monument which was
erected in honour of Mr. Cleveland, of the Civil Service, by the
Zamīndars, and was told, that at the other end of the station
is another monument erected to him by the Government. He
brought the Hill people into subjection, by whom he was styled
the “Father of their Country.” Bhagulpūr is eighteen miles
above Colgong; it is two hundred and sixty-eight miles by land
from Calcutta,—by water, from the same place, three hundred
and forty-eight miles in the rains, and six hundred and thirty-six
in the dry season,—and the dāk runs in two days and a
quarter. Steamers take nine and a half or eleven days to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
arrive here. A light kind of silk, called <i>tasar</i>, is sold in this
bazār, also, shot silks of various colours, useful for razāīs
and native wear, and a kind of cloth called bāftas. Here are a
few Hill rangers and a sepahī station.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—A pleasant and cool sail, the wind being fair at times;
lugāoed off a sandbank. But few insects, there being no trees
near us.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—To-day, to my sorrow, I was unable to pay the Rock
and Temple of Janghīra a visit, in consequence of the deep
stream being on the other side the river; still, I was near
enough to sketch it,—and very pretty and picturesque is its
situation. It is twenty-five miles above Bhagulpūr; the rocky
point on which the old ruined mosque stands, close to Janghīra,
with the mountains beyond, would form a good subject for a
picture. Just above the rock we met a large fleet of pinnaces,
budgerows, and country boats, of all sorts and sizes, conveying
the Buffs from Allahabad to Calcutta, for embarkation for
England; I counted sixty-four vessels. On account of their
coming down with the stream the sight was not as picturesque as
it would have been had they been going up the river. All
vessels put up very small low masts and scarcely any sail when
going with the stream, on account of its extreme velocity;
but ascending the river they carry very high masts, and an
overpowering quantity of sail. The last time I saw the Buffs
was at a ball they gave at Meerut,—a farewell on going to
Afghanistān.</p>

<p>The weather is now most agreeable, delightfully cool,—a sharp,
clear, pure air; we use a pankha at dinner-time, hung from the
ceiling of the cabin, but do not require it during the rest of the
day; the nights are cold. We have moored; and the poor
goats, who for three days have been on a barren sandbank of an
evening, have now a fine field of <i>urur</i> (cytisus cajan) to browse
upon. The people have cut some, and the goats will therefore
be happy to-morrow; this is a theft, but allowable on the banks
of the river, because a less rent is paid for land subject to the
visits of depredators from the Ganges.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—A large white house on the hill at Monghir is visible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
I was charmed with the scene when I went on deck at half-past
seven this morning: the river in this part is extremely broad
and very shallow, with a stream running like a mill-sluice; a
fair wind was blowing, and we were in the midst of about five
hundred vessels, which had been detained there in consequence
of the force of the stream. With this fine wind, however, they
all set sail; the lighter vessels with great difficulty passed the
bad part of the river, the larger and heavier craft got up to a
certain point, and beyond that they could not proceed, but one
by one lowered their sails, and fell back on a sandbank, where
they lay all in a row, like a line of soldiers. I amused myself
with watching the vessels as they came up to the testing point,
and went forward triumphantly, or fell back into the line of the
hopeless. The cook-boat, with our assistance, was brought up
with great difficulty; the budgerow bravely made way against the
fierce current; the woolāk, unable to stem the stream, fell back,
took some other passage, and parted company. Late at night
we anchored on one of those fine, hard, cool, clean sandbanks;
the sand is mixed with such a quantity of mica (<i>talc</i>), that at
night, by the light of a candle, it shines as if sprinkled with
silver-dust. We expected to have reached Monghir to-day, but
the winding of the river and the force of the stream have
prevented us.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Arrived at Monghir. The river-side was covered with
boats of all sorts as thickly planted as possible: the bazār
extends all along the edge of the river, and some good houses
belonging to the gentlemen at the station are on the higher
ground; the churchyard is beyond, and the Old Fort at the
point. The moment we anchored we were assailed with hundreds
of beggars; their clamour and cries were most annoying, they
were a complete pest,—driving them away was useless. The
people selling pistols, necklaces, bathing-chairs, baskets, toys,
shoes, &amp;c., raised such a hubbub, it was disgusting; we had all the
Venetians shut on that side, and the people had the impudence
to get down into the water and peep through them; the
chaprasīs drove them off, but they were back again the next
minute like a swarm of bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span></p>

<p>I may here insert a paragraph I saw in the papers:—</p>

<p>“The Asiatic Society has obtained an aërolite, or a mass of
meteoric iron, found imbedded in the soil on the top of the
Kurruckpore Hills, near Monghyr, which had been exhumed
and worshipped by the natives for many years. It is a block,
weighing about 160lbs., of a somewhat conical, oviform, disk
shape, standing on a sort of foot, and slightly truncated at both
ends; it contains iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, silica, alumina,
and traces of arsenic and selenium.”</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—The next day we started. The Fort is a good object
from this side, but, on turning the corner, how much was I
charmed to see the most picturesque cluster of <i>bairāgī</i> temples
imaginable! The <i>maths</i> are surrounded by fine trees, the ruined
bastion of the old fort juts out into the river, and has fragments
of rock at its base. The high spires of the white temples seen
among the trees, the slender bamboos with their bright red or
white flags, and a sort of Hindū altar in front, are beautifully
grouped. On a large stone in the river, just in front of the
temples, shaded from the sun by an immense <i>chatr</i> (umbrella)
made of straw, sat two Hindū priests, who were a picture in
themselves; upright at their side was a very high thin bamboo,
crowned with the branch of some holy tree, from which a lota was
suspended in the air. The whole was reflected in the Ganges, and
the vessels and distant land finished the picture. It came upon
me by surprise: had I known of the temples that were hidden
from my view by the bastion of the fort, I should have walked
there the evening before. The “Directory” tells you of the
articles in the bazār, but omits these gems of oriental beauty,
which are invaluable to a lover of the picturesque. Beyond
this stretch the walls of the old fort, which are of very great
extent, and the view of Monghir is good from this part of
the Ganges. Mr. D⸺ told us, that in coming up the river
during the last rains, the current at Colgong was terrific; on
the left bank was a whirlpool that set directly on the rocks, and
it would have been certain destruction to any boat attempting
that passage; and on the right bank was another whirlpool,
of such force, that, in tracking to a certain point, the dandīs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
jumped into the river, and fixed a hawser to prevent the vessel
being carried round and round by the current, and dashed
upon the rocks; with care this passage was navigable, but
the other was not to be attempted. From this gentleman’s
house on the hill at Monghir the view across the river was
bounded by the horizon, as at sea, the waters were so high
and the expanse so great.</p>

<p>Dwakanath Tagore is going to Europe for two years, and is to
visit the King of France. The magnet that attracts the Wise
Man of the East is the beauty of the opera-dancers, and the
delight above all others that he has at the opera in Paris, seeing,
as he says, three hundred of the most beautiful women in the
world all together;—the baboo is rather beside himself on the
subject.</p>

<p>According to the steam regulations, the Civil station of
Monghir is half-way from Calcutta,—one hundred and thirty-three
miles above Rajmahāl, and twenty-five above the rock of
Janghīra. Among the articles manufactured here, the black vases
for flowers, turned in white wood, and lacquered whilst on the
lathe with sealing-wax, are pretty. The necklaces and bracelets
in imitation of jet, at two or three rupees the set, are beautifully
made; necklaces of St. Agnes’s beads, monkeys, chameleons,
and male bamboos,—every thing is forthcoming in the bazār,
with the exception of ducks. The steamer’s passage is from
ten to fourteen days to this place,—three hundred and ninety-eight
miles by the Bhagirathī, six hundred and eighty-six by
Sunderbands, and three hundred and four by dāk; the latter
runs in two days and three-quarters. On arrival here the
collector’s and the magistrate’s book is sent on board, for entry of
all passengers’ names. Two miles S.W. by W. of Monghir are
some rocks, with a mark on them,—they were formerly in the
steamer’s track, but are now buried in an immense sandbank;
steamers stop here three or four hours for coals. Moored off
the village of Husseingunge.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—At noon passed the large village of Sūraj-garha,
twenty miles above Monghir, with a small river that runs down
from the hills; fowls and kids are procurable here, through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
jāmadār’s assistance, for boat travellers. Lugāoed off a sandbank;
the weather has become very cold,—the thermometer
this evening 72°, with a sharp wind.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—The river very uninteresting; the villages dirty and
disgusting, filled with pigs and most noisy beggars: moored the
boats as far away from a village as we could, and were even then
obliged to drive off the beggars, whose incessant noise left us
neither peace nor quiet.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Passed a remarkably fine banyan-tree, the roots of
which are exposed, from the river having washed away the earth;
would have stopped to sketch it, but could not venture on
shore amidst such a crowd of clamorous beggars and filthy
swine,—such pigs! so lank and lean, and long-legged and thin-flanked,
with staring bristles, all busily employed in turning up
the earth with their unringed noses! Old wretched beggar-women,
with their skeleton bodies and long white hair, are pursuing
the budgerow, uttering their monotonous cries for charity.
There is a tope of tamarind-trees that looks most inviting at
Bar, and the tar or fan palms are remarkably fine—the natives
say they are fifty cubits high. There are many spreading
banyan-trees near this place, and the scenery of the interior
looks very inviting. The large town and mart of Bar is on
the right bank of the river, sixty miles above Monghir, and
fifty below Dinapūr, a bye depôt for steamers’ coals; for twenty
miles above and below, all this bank of the river is noted for
piggery villages and saltpetre manufactories. Lugāoed a little
above Bar.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—After a most uninteresting day among shallows and sandbanks,
moored off Benīpūr: walked towards a light I saw at a distance,
and found a police-station. At the side was a burial-ground
of the Faithful; some Mahomedan saint was there entombed.
The light was burning in the niche of the pillar at the head of
the tomb. It was under a most magnificent old banyan-tree,
growing on a bank; the river had washed away the ground from
its roots, and they were starting forth in all picturesque forms.
Four large suckers having fallen to the ground, had each taken
root, and had attained the size of a tree—the great branches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
spread in every direction. Next to it was a remarkably fine
old tamarind-tree: two or three tombs were around under
the shadow of these and other trees; the lamp in the tomb
rendered them visible, and the young moon shed a bright light
between the boughs, but not sufficient to dispel the deep darkness
around. One of the banyan-trees to the left was so old, all
its branches had fallen off, and its trunk was cleft, open, and
hollow. It measured thirty feet in circumference: these ancient
trees and tombs would be a beautiful subject for a picture. I
asked a native at the spot to tear off a small branch of the
banyan-tree: he said, “You can gather a bough yourself, if you
like, but I cannot break one off from the tree that shades the
tomb of a <i>Pīr</i>,”—a saint.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—The “Directory” says, on the right bank, eighty-seven
miles above Monghir, and nine miles below the Patna, or rather
Bankipūr station, is a large native town, with a river on its
upper or western end that flows from the Hills, and has a
<i>pukka</i>, <i>i.e.</i> brick or stone bridge, over it. As we passed Futwa
early, some fat merchants, who were bathing in the river, asked
if we wanted any tablecloths or towels, for which the place is
famous. We anchored at a holy spot; the tomb of a saint is
there; both the tomb and the pillar are built of mud: it is
raised on a high platform of earth, which is well secured from
the inroads of the river by a palisade of the trunks of trees, the
outside being covered with old planks from vessels. The priest
showed it with great glee, and said, “It is <i>the command</i> that the
river shall never touch this holy tomb, which has stood here for
seven hundred years. You see it is built of mud; the river
overflows all the villages around, but this place is untouched.
It is the command that the tomb is never to be built of stone.”
On my remarking the strength of the palisades, he was much
inclined to be abusive, and demanded alms with the outcries
and whine of a beggar.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—The first glance on the river this morning delighted
me: we were off an old ruined bastion which had partly fallen
into the stream; on its top was a beautiful <i>burj</i> (turret)—there was
another bastion a little further on, and then some temples and two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
more burūj. We had now arrived at Azīmabad, as the ancient
city of Patna is called by the Muhammadans, which extends a
great distance along the bank of the river, and is supposed to
have been, among others, the site of the ancient Palibothra;
the Hindoo appellation is Sri Nagar.</p>

<p>“The hypocrites of Bhagulpūr, the footpads of Kuhulgaon,
and the bankrupts of Patna, are all famous<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.” The Hindoos
were coming down in large parties, preceded by tom-toms
(native drums), and musical instruments of all sorts, to bring
their offerings to the river. They carried baskets filled with
fruits or vegetables to the river-side, and great bunches of
plantains, and washed them in the river. The Brahmans poured
water on the offerings, prayers were repeated, the people bathed
and returned home.</p>

<p>It was the festival of the Sun—the Sūraj Pūja. The dresses
of the people were of the most brilliant colours. Flags of a
bright crimson colour, bearing the image of Hŭnūmān blazoned
in white upon them, were flying at the end of long slender
bamboos.</p>

<p>Advancing higher up the river, near the old fort, there are
picturesque houses of all sorts, intermixed with Hindoo temples,
fine trees, and distant masjids. A sandbank in the centre of
the Ganges was covered with temporary huts of straw, where the
devout were bathing and offering flowers and fruits; it was a
beautiful scene, that animated multitude on the sandbank and in
the river, with the high bank on the opposite side covered with
the houses and the temples of the city. The pinnaces and vessels
of all sorts were decked with flags. Large parties of women,
dressed in the gayest attire and the most various colours, were
doing pūja, bathing in the river, or presenting their offerings of
fruit, flowers, &amp;c., to the attendant Brahmans. “While bathing,
the Hindoos repeat certain incantations, in order to bring the
waters of all the holy places in the heaven of Sōōryŭ into the
spot where they are standing, and thus obtain the merit of
bathing, not only in Gunga, but in all the sacred rivers, &amp;c., in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
heaven of the Sun-god. After bathing, too, the Hindoos make
their obeisance to this god in a standing posture; the more devout
draw up their joined hands to their forehead, gaze at the sun,
make prostrations to him, and then turn round seven times,
repeating certain forms of petition and praise. On these occasions
they hold up water in their joined hands, and then pour out
a drink-offering to the sun.” The number of boats off Patna is
quite surprising. There is a boat-builder’s on the opposite sandbank,
and a great number of vessels with large timber-trees
are off the place. Passing Hadjipūr, we were not tempted to
go on shore, although the fair was being held there, not requiring
elephants, horses, or shawls. The bungalow and race-course
are on the left bank of the Gunduk that runs from the
Nepaul Hills; the large native town is on the right bank.
People flock from all parts of India to its annual fair, which
will last this month as long as the moon shines. We anchored
on a sandbank in the middle of the river, nearly opposite the
Golā or Gol-ghar. The “Directory” says, Patna, the Civil station
of Bankipūr, extends about ten miles along the right bank,
fourteen miles below Dinapūr. It is noted for opium, gram,
and wax candles, and is a very large mart. Seventeen hundred
boats of burden have been counted lying here at one time. It
is the residence of a Nawāb, and a Sadr and Civil station.
The Government establishments are at Bankipūr, or the upper
extreme of Patna, where there are some handsome houses, also
a very large and noted granary built like a dome, with two
flights of steps outside, to ascend to its top, on which is a large
circular hole, to admit air into the building, and to start grain
into; it has only one door, and was built for a depôt in case of
famine. It is a very massive building, noted for its numerous,
clear, and strong echoes, and is at present used as a guardhouse.</p>

<p>Steamers seldom stop here: sometimes not being able to get
within a mile or two, passengers can land at the lower end and
get <i>ekhas</i>, or hackeries, (a native one-horse conveyance,) to take
them up to Bankipūr or Dinapūr, fourteen miles distant, by
way of a change or novelty, where they can inspect the golā<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
or granary by the road-side. The road is very good up to the
military cantonments at Dinapūr.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Landed to go to Havell’s farm at Deegah; found his
widow there—a very old half-caste personage. The establishment
must have been a fine one formerly; now the sheds are all
empty, and scarcely any thing is done there. Ordered some
beef brawn and Chili vinegar, both of which proved good. On
our arrival at Dinapūr my mānjhī wished to anchor under the
flag-staff, to which I objected, on account of the crowd of
boats there: had to go on the distance of a kos, until we were
past the Lines, to the ghāt opposite the native hospital,—a very
uncomfortable place.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Bought a mŭn of six-inch wax candles of Kinnoo Lall,
price eighty rupees. Much disgusted with the annoyance of
being obliged to procure fresh dāndīs for the woolāk, and having
to send a chaprāsī with the manjhī to fetch them from the other
side of the river.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—The sardar-bearer here informed us he intended to
quit us; this was troublesome; indeed, the homes of the people
being often near Dinapūr, the servants select this place for
quitting their masters and going home, with or without warning,
just as it may suit their own convenience. At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the fresh
dāndīs arrived for the woolāk; how glad I shall be to get away
from this place!</p>

<p>Dinapūr is a large European and military station, where the
steamers stop by the cantonment flag-staff to take in coals and
passengers. It is considered as two-thirds of the passage upwards.
It is on the right bank of the Ganges, distant from
Calcutta by steamer’s route, viâ Bhagirathī, five hundred and
eight miles; viâ Sunderbands, seven hundred and ninety-six; by
land, three hundred and seventy-six. The letter dāk takes three
and a half days. Mutton, beef, fowls, eggs, bread, butter,
fruits of various kinds, and grapes in May and June are procurable;
also tablecloths, napkins, towels, cotton handkerchiefs, sola
hats, muslin and cotton cloth, shoes, harness, Patna wax candles,
gram, wild fowl, &amp;c. European shopkeepers are here. Plays
are performed and auctions held. Passengers for Arrah and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
Tirhoot land here. Quitted Dinapūr with great pleasure, and
came to very agreeable moorings off Chittenniaw—a great
relief after the annoyance of being near the ghāt of a large
station. The people with us will now be well behaved, and
give no more trouble to the end of the voyage; <i>i.e.</i>, until we
arrive at Allahabad.</p>

<p><i>1844, Nov. 20th.</i>—To-day the scenery has been most uninteresting;
nothing to be seen but sandbanks; the river is full
of shallows, and there is no wind. Lugāoed on a fine open
space in the middle of the river; it is really a good-sized island
of fine and beautifully white sand. Four miles above Dinapūr
is the junction of the Soane with the Ganges.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Sandbanks and shallows the whole day: we have
advanced very little, and have moored as usual on a bank.
Looking around me, I see nothing but a wilderness of sandbanks
in the midst of the broad river, only terminating with the
horizon—not a tree, not a house to be seen; here and there a
distant sail. There is something very pleasing in this monotonous
solitude; the only sound the roar of the sandbanks, as
they give way and fall into the stream, with a noise like distant
thunder. These high sandbanks are undermined by the strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
current, and fall in in great masses—very dangerous to small
vessels passing near them.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—“Twenty-two miles above Dinapūr,” says the “Directory,”
“on the left bank, is the Civil station of Chuppra, the
capital of the Sarun district. Steamers seldom touch here,
even in the rains. Passengers for this place should arrange to
land at Revelgunge, above it, where there is a steam agent.
The latter place, which is twenty-seven miles by water above
Dinapūr, on the left bank, is a very large grain and saltpetre
mart, and noted for boat-building. An annual fair is held there.
Steamers touch only to land passengers and a few packages to
the steam agent’s care. Thence up to Ghazipūr the villagers
are said to be uncivil and dishonest.”</p>

<p>We had a view of Chuppra from a distance, and then passed
Revelgunge. The tents of a Rāja were pitched on the side of
the Ganges, with the <i>khanats</i> extending on both sides into the
river to screen the Rāja from the eyes of the curious, as he sat
under a <i>shamiyana</i> (awning) in the centre. His camp contained
several elephants, one most remarkably large, a number of
fine horses and camels, and all the retinue of a wealthy native.
Moored a little above Revelgunge.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—A fair wind. Lugāoed off a small <i>bastī</i> (village).</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—A fair wind. Anchored off Bulleah: a large fair was
being held there on the banks of the river; we moored two
miles away from it, but the din and uproar, even at that distance,
was like the sound of waves breaking on a distant shore.
I walked to the fair; it was late in the evening, and nothing was
to be seen but thousands of people sitting in groups on the
ground cooking their dinners, or lying there asleep. Some
groups of people were watching the performance of nāch girls,
<i>go’ālā log</i>, and dancing boys: every man had a long heavy
bamboo in his hand, as a defence, and a walking staff.</p>

<p>The fakīrs had erected altars of mud, on the top of each of
which was stuck a long bamboo, decorated with a flag. These
holy personages, entirely naked, were sitting on the ground
under some freshly-gathered boughs that were stuck up on one
side. If one could but learn the real history of one of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
men, it would give one a curious insight into human nature. A
fakīr of this description is looked upon with respect by the
natives; “No one inquires his caste or tribe; he has put on
the string, and is therefore a Brahman<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.”</p>

<p>These men sit up all night by a fire, smoking ganja, an intoxicating
herb, eating sweetmeats and ghī, and drinking milk.
They never put on any sort of clothing, and never sleep under
shelter. They say they do not feel the cold, and they eat the
offerings that are made to them. They must receive very large
sums; the bearers give from one to four paisā to these fellows,
and a rich Hindū gives a rupee. Groups of people were sitting
together singing and playing on tom-toms; the din was excessive,
and the smoke very annoying from the innumerable fires
around the pathway. To-morrow will be the last day of the
fair.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—From 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> until 11 o’clock we were striving to get
the boats past the fair, which extended for miles along the
bank of the river. It being the early morning, the people were
bathing by thousands; the bank for miles was covered with
moving figures ascending and descending the steep cliff in masses
as thick as they could move. The river below was alive with the
devout. Hindūs of all and every class were bathing and performing
their devotions. The budgerow was stopped some time
from the difficulty of passing her <i>gūn</i>, (tracking line,) over the
tops of so many high masts; some persons cut the gūn, and
they ran away with part of it, which theft detained us some
time. The manner in which, by the aid of a bamboo, the
tracking rope is carried to the top of a mast and thrown over it,
is curious.</p>

<p>By the side of the river I saw several fakīrs bathing; they
had thick heads of hair and enormous beards. One man had
his hand and arm erect: it was only partly withered, his vow
must therefore have been recently made, or the arm would have
been withered to the bone and immovably fixed in its position.
His body was covered with ashes, and his long elf locks, matted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
with cow-dung and yellow clay, hung down like so many rusty
yellow tails. Hundreds of boats were bringing more people to
the fair. The morning being cold, the people, wrapped up in
great white sheets, were huddled together in the boats, as many
as it was possible to cram together; and at a distance the vessels
looked as if they were filled with bales of cotton.</p>

<p>Cows were numerous, and were undergoing the usual pūja.
Sometimes a Brahman was seen seated on a charpāī with a
chatr over his head, the charpāī supported on four bamboos
that were erected in the river, and a fine triangular red flag
flying from each end of the four bamboos. The effect was very
picturesque: red and also white flags were in profusion, denoting
the abiding place of a fakīr. Beauty was extremely scarce
amongst the women. Some of the men had fine features—the
skin of some of the latter was almost of a transparent black, that
of others of a dark brown hue, and some exhibited a bright <i>terra
di sienna</i> tint. I saw no lepers, which is remarkable; it is usual
to see one of the pink-coloured lepers amongst any great multitude
bathing; and that leprosy not being catching, the people are
not driven from the society of their fellows, as are those who are
afflicted with the Arabian leprosy.</p>

<p>I think the number of people collected at this fair appears
greater than the number I ever saw collected at Prāg; the cliff
for miles was covered with a countless multitude. Perhaps the
people were more conspicuous on the cliffs than on the flat sands
at the Tribeni. A number of respectable-looking Hindoo
women were in boats covered with an awning. This large
native village of Bulleah is seventy-four miles above Dinapūr,
on the left bank: it is a <i>dārogah</i> station, noted for the fair
annually held there, as also for a grain mart.</p>

<p>This is the most dangerous part of the Ganges for quicksands
and shifting banks: the stream is very strong, boats being sometimes
detained from four to six weeks, waiting for water and a
favourable breeze. The people carry away the Ganges water from
this place in sealed bottles, as they do from Prāg, and sell it in
distant parts of the country at a high price. We had a hard day’s
work tracking amidst the sandbanks against a rapid stream, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
did not anchor until the sun had set for an hour and a half, and
the full moon was high. I was very glad to see the moon; we
were in a dilemma on a bad spot in the river; however, after
much labour we got off, and lugāoed on a comfortable sandbank.
A large vessel belonging to a Mirzapūr merchant was wrecked
here a month ago; I visited the wreck,—they have recovered
all but fourteen bales of linen, which they are digging out,—they
lie twelve feet under the sand. In the evening the manjhī
of my boat was preparing a bamboo to use for pushing the
budgerow onwards; I measured it as it lay on the ground; it was
sixty feet in length, and most beautifully tapered; he said he
had some spare ones on board much longer; for nine of these
bamboos he only paid one rupee, and he bought them at the
spot where the Bhagirathī branches off from the Ganges. At
Prāg such a bamboo would have cost eight ānās. A chaukidār
has erected a hut close to the wreck with her fragments; there
he and his people keep guard over her; in front is an image of
Mahadēo, made in mud, and ornamented with fresh green plantain
trees stuck into the sand around the idol.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Anchored early at Buxar, just under the fort. When
walking to see the fort I was attracted to the left by the beauty
of a most remarkably fine old peepul-tree, which overshadows
a temple dedicated to Mahadēo, whose image is within the
building; on the outer wall is an image of Hūnūmān. The
temple is beautifully overshadowed, and the stems of the peepul-tree—for
it is divided into many—are old and picturesque, and
the smallness of the leaves denotes the antiquity of the tree. On
the bank of the river there is also an old peepul-tree,—its long
branching roots are exposed to view, the river having laid them
bare by washing away the bank. Buxar on the right, and
Kuruntadee on the left bank, are eighty-eight miles above
Dinapūr, and are noted as being the Honourable Company’s stud
establishment: there is a small fort here where the battle was
fought.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Quitted Buxar early, and were forced to anchor for a
time at Chounsah Beerboom, on account of a very heavy wind,
which made old Gunga rise in waves, and rocked the budgerow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
like a sea: started at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and arrived at the Kurum-nassa
river; it is a shallow, melancholy-looking, small stream, with
nothing to be seen on its banks but fishermen’s nets. <i>Hilsā</i>
fish are here caught in great numbers, and the <i>rahū</i> also; I
purchased one of the latter, and some quail, which were twenty-five
per rupee.</p>

<p>Lugāoed at Barrah, a small village on the right bank: climbed
the cliff in the evening; a fisherman who resided there showed
me two satī mounds on the top of it,—the one built of stone
sacred to a Brahmān, the other of mud in honour of a Kyiatt.
A <i>kalsā</i> is the ornament on the top of a dome; there were two of
stone, without any points on the satī mound of the Brahmān;
and two of mud, decorated with points, and one small image, on
that of the Kyiatt<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>I gave a small present to the people, and took away one of
the kalsās of mud as a curiosity: a number of broken idols in
black stone had been dug up, and placed on the satī mound of
the Brahmān,—I was anxious to have two of them, and determined
to ask the fisherman to give them to me. The old man
told me with great pride that one of his family had been a satī,
and that the Brahmāns complained greatly they were not allowed
to burn the widows, as such disconsolate damsels were ready
and willing to be grilled; he told me that a great number of
mounds are on the left bank of the river, just opposite at
Beerpūr, and that there are several about two miles higher up
the stream.</p>

<p>The Brahmānī ducks are calling to one another from the
opposite banks of the river,—there must be several pairs of them
from the ā’o! ā’o! that I hear; this is only the second time
during this voyage that I have heard the chakwā. The wind is
down, there is a soft and brilliant moonlight,—the weather is
really charming, and the moonlight nights delicious; from the
high bank by the satīs one can see the stream of the Ganges
below, glittering in its beams.</p>

<p>“Eight miles above Buxar, on the right bank of the river, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
the junction of the Kurum-nassa: the touch of its waters is
considered as one of the direst mishaps that can happen to a
Hindū, as it is said it debars him admittance into heaven.
There is a bridge over it, built by a Rajah; this part of the
country is noted for decoits.” The bridge, which is some
distance up the river, is not visible from the junction.</p>

<p>Ten <i>P.M.</i>; I have just returned from the satī mound, accompanied
by the old fisherman, who brought with him two of the
idols of black stone from the Brahmān’s mound, on which there
were about twenty; the old man gave them to me the moment
I asked for them; I gave him a present afterwards, therefore he
did not sell his gods; but he requested to be allowed to bring them
to the boats during the darkness of the night. He and his family
are now the sole inhabitants of a little hamlet of five houses,
which was formerly inhabited by himself and his four brothers;
they are dead, and their houses, which are in ruins, are close to
the mounds; the old man lives in the centre, with one young son
and two daughters, and keeps his dwelling of mud in comfortable
condition. They tell me fowls and <i>chakor</i> (the red-legged
partridge) are abundant there; I was unable to procure the
latter.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Stopped the budgerow for a few minutes off the ruins
of the palace of the Nawāb of Ghazipūr. The fort-like bastions
rise from the Ganges, and the palace is built above; the ghāt is
of stone, wide and good: this ruined palace has been before
described in this volume, <a href="#Page_66">page 66</a>. The native town of Ghazipūr
is full of picturesque beauty; the <i>mut’hs</i> are numerous, but
their architectural beauty is disfigured by whitewash and edges
of dark red paint. There is a gigantic image in mud smeared
with paint, which lies upon its back close to the water’s edge,
and has a curious effect: a little further on an old well has fallen
into the river, on account of the high cliff within which it was
sunk having been washed away; the cliff, which is of sand, and
very high, is covered with native houses, small temples, and
trees, from the top to the bottom.</p>

<h3>THREE SATĪS AND A MANDAP NEAR GHAZIPŪR.</h3>

<p>Lugāoed close to a small and very pretty mandap or Hindū
temple. I went up to see it; the Brahmān opened the door,
and showed me his idols with much pleasure. They consisted
of Seeta, Rām, and Lutchman, painted red, and decked with bits
of gold and silver tinsel, and pieces of coloured cloth. Hūnoomān
was displayed on the wall painted red, and decked also with
red linen. The Brahmān gave me a ball of sweetmeat, which
he said was the usual offering at the shrine. Two fine peepul-trees,
which had been planted together, are on the high bank
above the temple, and within their shade are three satīs, built of
stone, of octagonal form, and surmounted by a dome: the point
of the dome is ornamented with a kalsā formed like a crown
with a hole in the centre, and on each of its points or horns, on
certain days, a lighted lamp is placed. The cenotaph is hollow
below; and there is a little arch, through which the relatives
also on particular days place a small lamp, and offerings of
flowers within the cavity of the little building, and in the same
place the two <i>sīr</i> are deposited. The kalsās differ in form from
those at Barrah; and the satīs are also of higher caste, being of
stone and well built. If the moon rise in time, I will sketch
the spot, but I am very much fatigued, and my head aches, not
only from exposure to the sun, but from a blow I received upon
it from the tracking rope this morning. The insects do not
molest us now at night, with the exception of the musquitoes,
which are very troublesome.</p>

<p>On the rising of the moon I went on shore to take the sketch,
and was attracted by what appeared to be the figure of a man
watching from under a tree on a high cliff. On going up to it
I found a satī, which had fallen to ruin; the remains were
whitewashed, and a large kalsā had been placed on the top,
which being also whitewashed, at a distance produced the
deception. See fig. 2, which is a sketch of this kalsā; the satī
herself, partially wrapped in her sarī, is seated upon it; it
is adorned with points, and made of mud. I brought the kalsā
away with me; it will be replaced by the <i>kumhār</i>, or potter of the
village, whose duty it is to restore all kalsās. On the other side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
of the old tree was another satī mound, and small <i>lotās</i>, earthen
drinking vessels, were hung around the tree to receive the offerings
of the devout. I had the curiosity to put my hand into
one of them, and found one betel-nut which had been placed
there as an offering. Peeping over a high bank, I saw an open
space of ground, on which were some fine trees, and I could
scarcely believe the number of mounds that met my eye were
those of victimized women. By a little <i>détour</i> I found the
entrance to this place of cenotaphs, and was shocked on
counting eight-and-twenty satīs. I was alone; had a Hindū
been with me, he would have made salām to each of them.</p>

<p>One was large and somewhat in the shape of a grave, after
the form of the satī of the Brahmān at Barrah. The others were
of various forms; the richer ones were of stone, of an octagonal
shape, and surmounted by a dome; some were so small
and low, they were not higher than one foot from the earth,
like a little ant hill, but ornamented with a kalsā, which quite
covered the little mound. Those of stone were from six to
eight feet high, and of various forms. There is a hollow space
within the satī, into which, through the little arch, the offerings
are placed; and there also are deposited the two <i>sīr</i>, as they call
them, which are made of stone, and are like a cannon ball
split in halves. See <a href="#plate44">the plate of the kalsās</a>, fig. 1. One very
old satī tomb, in ruins, stood on the edge of the high cliff above
the river, shaded by a clump of bamboos. The spot interested
me extremely. It is very horrible to see how the weaker are
imposed upon; and it is the same all over the world, civilized or
uncivilized—perhaps some of these young married women, from
eleven to twenty years of age, were burnt alive, in all the freshness
of youth; it may be with the corpse of some decrepit sickly old
wretch to whom their parents had given them in marriage.</p>

<p>The laws of England relative to married women, and the state
of slavery to which those laws degrade them, render the lives of
some few in the higher, and of thousands in the lower ranks of
life, one perpetual satī, or burning of the heart, from which they
have no refuge but the grave, or the cap of liberty,—<i>i.e.</i> the
widow’s, and either is a sad consolation.</p>

<p>“It is this passive state of suffering which is most difficult to
endure, and which it is generally the fate of women to experience.
It is too commonly their lot to be deceived into a
belief, that as they are the gentler sex, so they ought to be the
weakest. Alas, it is far otherwise; the soldier covered with
wounds of glory, the mariner warring with the elements, the
sage consuming his strength with the midnight oil, or the bigot
wearing life away with fanatical zeal in false devotion, require
not the unshrinking firmness, the never-failing patience, the
unbending fortitude which is expected from almost every
woman.”</p>

<p>The river has encroached so much upon the cliff, and so much
ground has fallen in, that, probably, the place of the satīs was of
much larger extent; next year, most likely, those that are now
tottering on the edge of the cliff will fall into the depth below.
From this place I returned to the mandap, and sketched the
satīs I had first seen. Their kalsās had figures upon them,
meant to represent the husband and wife; I brought three of
these ornaments away,—they have received all the honours;
their foreheads have been marked with red paint, lamps have been
lighted and placed upon their points, and offerings have been laid
before them. Pretty well fagged with my moonlight expedition,
I returned to the boats and slept quietly,—a great blessing.</p>

<p>4 and 5. These kalsās were taken from the satī ground at
Ghazipūr, where there were twenty-eight cenotaphs, and which
was only a short distance from the three satīs represented in the
other plate. On both of them are curious representations of the
husband and wife sitting side by side.</p>

<p>6. This kalsā differs from the rest, being hollow at the top,
and the upper part of the dome of the cenotaph passed through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
it; on the points of its horns, the Brahmān said, lights were
placed on particular days. It was taken off the top of the satī
in the foreground of the sketch, over which two lotas are
suspended to receive the offerings of the pious. Each of these
kalsās had four horns; they were much damaged by time, and
some of the horns were broken off; they were formed of coarse
red pottery.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—Quitted the satī ground, and came up to the Cantonment
ghāt just below the tomb of the Marquis Cornwallis. We
are now in the north-western provinces, in which my husband
holds his appointment under the Lieutenant-Governor of Agra,
and have announced our arrival in due form.</p>

<p>The Civil and Military station of Ghazipūr is one hundred
and nineteen miles above Dinapūr, or thirty-one miles above
Buxar on the left bank of the river. The native town is built
on precipices; the European inhabitants reside on a large plain
about the centre of the station; the cantonments form the
upper part, and the European hospital is at the other extreme.
Between the Civil and Military lines are the chapel and the tomb.
It is noted for its opium manufactory, and Government stud establishment,
where horses can be purchased, as also for its rose-water,
atr of roses, and other perfumed oils. Provisions of all
sorts may be purchased here, also European articles and millinery.
Its distance from Calcutta, viâ Bhagirathī, is six hundred
and twenty-seven miles, viâ Sunderbunds nine hundred
and fifteen, and by land four hundred and thirty-one. The
dāk runs in four days—steamer’s passage, from seventeen to
twenty days: they remain here for passengers, cargo, and coal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
Passengers for Ghoruckpūr should land here. This is the
lower extreme of the North-Western Provinces, or Agra Presidency,
and is a great place of trade; it is also the lowest
station for the Agra flat-boats. <i>Kankarī</i> banks, a sort of stony
gravel, commence here, and run hence upwards. At this station
we purchased game; a man came to our boats, and offered two
wild geese and three wild ducks for sale; he carried a long
native matchlock, and led a cow by a string; this cow he used
as a stalking horse, the birds being so shy it would otherwise
be impossible to get within shot distance.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 1st.</i>—A good day, having had but little contrary wind;
lugāoed off Booraneepūr. On the edge of the high cliff stood
a little temple and a large peepul-tree, very picturesque, which
induced me to climb the rough kankarī bank, and to find my
way to the temple through a deserted village; there were a great
number of ruined huts, and very few inhabitants; the village
dogs barked most fiercely at a distance, and skulked away at my
approach. This is the fall of the leaf, and the large peepul-tree
was nearly leafless, which showed off its long and peculiar
branches; one branch, at the height of about eight feet from the
ground, stretched out in a horizontal direction to the length of
sixty feet: although it is now winter for the peepul, in three
weeks more it will be covered with fresh green leaves. At the foot
of the tree was a large satī mound of mud; it was so much
neglected that no pious hand had placed even a kalsā on the
top, and not a flower had been offered there, nor a lamp burned in
pūja. A little Hindoo temple of octagonal form stood on the
extreme edge of the cliff, some fragments of idols were placed
against its side; no Brahmān was there, and the place looked
cold and desolate; a young banyan tree formed the background,
and the Ganges spread its broad waters to the far horizon.</p>

<p>The “Directory” says,—“Eight miles above Ghazipūr is the
dangerous kankār reef that strikes directly across the river.
Twenty-three miles above Ghazipūr is Chochookpore stone
ghāt and temple, noted for the numerous monkeys that resort
there. Two miles above Chochookpore, on the right bank of
the river, is the sunken rock, opposite to a palm-tree just below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
Sanotie.” All the difficulties and dangers, monkeys and all, we
have passed to-day, without being conscious of their existence;
the monkeys and temples I was sorry I did not see,—we passed
without observing them. The river has been very uninteresting,
nothing to look at, and very few vessels: moored on a most
solitary and insulated sandbank.</p>

<p>“Thirty miles above Ghazipūr by Kucharee, on the left bank, is
a difficult channel with a dangerous sunken reef. Six miles above
it is Seydpūr, a large native town, with a <i>tahsīldār</i> and a <i>dārogha</i>:
and two miles above Seydpūr is the junction of the Goomtie
river, that goes up to Lucnow, said to be a very intricate and
rocky stream, too shallow for the smallest boats in the dry
season. The Ganges, from above Kucharee reef, past Seydpūr,
up to the Goomtie, a distance of eight miles, is a very difficult
passage, with various bad patches of kankar rock, on which
native boats and budgerows split instantaneously.</p>

<p>“Five miles above the Goomtie is Chandroutī, with a white
temple. In mid-channel is a very dangerous pakka platform, on
kankar, with the ruins of an old temple on it, and no passable
channel on its north-west or Zinhore side, and very dangerous
for downward-bound boats, as the current sets directly upon it.”
At Seydpūr is a very elaborately carved mandap or Hindū
temple, of elegant form.</p>

<h3>FUNERAL RITES.—BURNING THE DEAD.</h3>

<p>As our boats passed slowly along, we had an opportunity of
witnessing the funeral rites of the Hindūs: the burning of a
corpse was being performed just at the base of the cliff on the
edge of the river. The nearest relative, as is the custom, was
stirring up the body, and pushing it well into the flames with a
long pole: much oil and ghī must have been expended and
poured over the wood, as it burnt fiercely. The face of the
corpse looked cold and pale and fixed, as the wind blew aside
the flames and smoke, and enabled me to behold a scene that
shocked me: in all probability the son was performing the
ceremony. We read of the Romans burning their dead, regard
it in a classical light, and think of it without disgust,—but when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
you see the ceremony really performed it is very painful: nevertheless,
a sort of absurdity was mixed with it in my mind, as
“stir him up with the long pole” flashed across my memory. A
group of relatives were sitting by the river-side, watching the
ceremony; on its conclusion they will bathe and return to their
homes.</p>

<p>The <i>kapāl-krīyā</i>, a ceremony among Hindūs, is, that when a
dead body is burning, and nearly reduced to ashes, the nearest
relation breaks the skull with the stroke of a bamboo, and pours
ghī (clarified butter) into the cavity. Hence <i>kapāl-krīyā karna</i>,
to think intensely, to beat or cudgel one’s brains.</p>

<p>The charpāī on which the corpse had been carried, being
reckoned unclean, had been thrown into the river, and the
broken lota that had contained ghī was at its side. The scene
was reflected in the Ganges. From the quantity of wood and ghī
consumed the departed must have been a rich man: the relatives
of the very poor scarcely do more than scorch the body, and
throw it into the river, where it floats swollen and scorched—a
horrible sight.</p>

<p>“The burning of the body is one of the first ceremonies the
Hindūs perform for the help of the dead in a future state. If
this ceremony have not been attended to, the rites for the repose
of the soul cannot be performed. If a person be unable to
provide wood, cloth, clarified butter, rice, water-pans, and other
things, besides the fee for the priest, he must beg among his
neighbours. If the body be thrown into the river, or burnt,
without the accustomed ceremonies, as is sometimes the case,
the ceremonies may be performed over an image of the deceased
made of kooshŭ grass. Immediately after death the attendants
lay out the body on a sheet, placing two pieces of wood under
the head and feet; after which they anoint the corpse with
clarified butter, bathe it with the water of the Ganges, put round
the loins a new garment, and another over the left shoulder, and
then draw the sheet on which the body lies over the whole.
The heir-at-law next bathes himself, puts on new garments, and
boils some rice, a ball of which and a lighted brand he puts to
the mouth of the deceased, repeating incantations. The pile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
having been prepared he sets fire to it, and occasionally throws
on it clarified butter and other combustibles. When the body is
consumed he washes the ashes into the river; the attendants
bathe, and presenting a drink-offering to the deceased, return
home: before they enter the house, however, each one touches
fire and chews some bitter leaves, to signify that parting with
relations by death is an unpleasant task.”</p>

<p>The rites for the repose of the soul, the offerings made in a
person’s name after his decease, and the ceremonies which take
place on the occasion, are called his shraddhŭ; which the
Hindūs are very anxious to perform in a becoming manner.
The son who performs these rites obtains great merit; the
deceased is satisfied, and by gifts to the Brahmāns in his name
he obtains heaven.</p>

<p>The Hindū shastrŭs teach that after death the soul becomes
<i>prétŭ</i>, a departed ghost,—namely, takes a body about the size
of a person’s thumb, and remains in the custody of Yŭmŭ, the
judge of the dead. At the time of receiving punishment the
body becomes enlarged, and is made capable of enduring sorrow.
The performance of the rites for the repose of the soul, delivers
the deceased at the end of a year from this state, and translates
him to the heaven of the Pitrees, where he enjoys the reward of
his meritorious actions, and afterwards in another body, enters
into that state which the nature of his former actions assign to
him. If the shraddhŭ be not performed the deceased remains
in the prétŭ state, and cannot enter another body.</p>

<p>There are three shraddhŭs for the dead: one, eleven days
after the death; another, every month; and another, at the
close of a year after a person’s decease. During the ten days of
mourning the relatives hold a family council, and consult on the
means of performing the shraddhŭ; on the last of these days,
after making an offering for the dead by the side of the river,
they are shaved. On the next day after the performance of
numerous ceremonies, and offerings made to the priests, the son
goes into the house, and placing a Brahmān and his wife on a
seat, covers them with ornaments, worships them, and adding a
large present of money, dismisses them. After this the son of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
deceased requests five Brahmāns to offer a male calf, in doing
which they take two cloths each, four poitas, four betel-nuts,
and some kourees, and go with the company to a spot where an
altar has been prepared, one cubit high, and four cubits square.
Four of the Brahmāns sit on the four sides of the altar, and
there worship certain gods, and offer a burnt sacrifice. Near the
altar are placed the shalgramŭ, four female calves, a male calf,
and a vilwŭ post. The fifth Brahmān reads a portion of a
poorană, to drive away evil spirits. The female calves are tied
to four vilwŭ posts, and the male calf to a post called vrishŭ
post. To the necks of the cow-calves four small slender baskets
are suspended, in which are placed, among other things, a comb,
and the iron instrument with which Hindū women blacken their
eyelids. A sheet of metal is placed under the belly of the bull-calf,—on
the back a sheet of copper: the hoofs are covered
with silver, and the horns with gold, if the shraddhŭ be performed
by a rich man. On the hips of the bull-calf marks of
Shivŭ’s trident are impressed with a hot iron. After this the
son of the deceased washes the tail of the bull-calf, and with
the same water presents a drink-offering to his deceased
ancestors: and afterwards marries the bull-calf to the four cow-calves,
repeating many formulas, in which they are recommended
to cultivate love and mutual sympathy. The son next liberates
the cow-calves, forbidding any one to detain them, or partake of
their milk in future. In liberating the male calf, he says, “I
have given thee these four wives, live with them! Thou art the
living image of Yŭmŭ; thou goest upon four legs. Devour not
the corn of others, &amp;c.” The cow-calves are generally taken by
Brahmāns, the bull-calf is let loose, to go where he pleases:
these bulls wander about, and are treated by the Hindūs with
great respect; no one can claim any redress for the injury they
do, and no Hindū dare destroy them. The English call them
“Brahmanī bulls.” There are various other rites too numerous
to detail, and the sums are enormous which at times are spent
on the shraddhŭ.</p>

<p>The funeral rites of the Romans and those of the Hindūs are
not very dissimilar. The Romans paid the greatest attention to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
them, because they believed that the souls of the unburied were
not admitted into the abodes of the dead; or at least wandered
a hundred years along the river Styx, before they were allowed
to cross it; for which reason, if the bodies of their friends
could not be found, they erected to them an empty tomb (<i>cenotaphium</i>),
at which they performed the usual solemnities; and to
want the due rites was esteemed the greatest misfortune. The
nearest relation closed the eyes and mouth of the deceased, and
when the eyes were closed they called upon the deceased by
name several times at intervals: the corpse was then laid on the
ground, bathed, and anointed with perfumes. The body, dressed
in the best attire which the deceased had worn when alive, was
laid on a couch in the vestibule, with the feet outwards; the
couch was sometimes decked with leaves and flowers. A small
coin (<i>triens</i> vel <i>obolus</i>) was put in his mouth, which he might
give to Charon for his freight. The Romans at first usually
interred their dead, which is the most ancient and most natural
method. They early adopted the custom of burning (<i>cremandi</i>
vel <i>comburendi</i>) from the Greeks, which is mentioned in the laws
of Numa, and of the twelve tables, but it did not become
general till towards the end of the republic. Numa forbade his
own body to be burned, according to the custom of the Romans,
but he ordered it to be buried near Mount Janiculum, with
many of the books which he had written. Sylla was the first
of the Patrician branch of the <i>gens Cornelia</i> that was burnt;
which is supposed to have been in accordance with his wishes;
for, having ordered the remains of Marius to be taken out of his
grave, and thrown into the river Anio, he was apprehensive of
the same insult. Sylla died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 78. Pliny ascribes the first
institution of burning among the Romans to their having discovered
that the bodies of those who fell in distant wars were dug
up by the enemy. Under the emperors it became almost universal,
but was afterwards gradually dropped upon the introduction
of Christianity, so that it had fallen into disuse about the
end of the fourth century. On the day of the funeral, when
the people were assembled, the body was carried out with the
feet foremost on a couch, covered with rich cloth, and supported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
commonly on the shoulders of the nearest relations of
the deceased or of his heirs. Poor citizens were carried to the
funeral pile in a plain bier or coffin, usually by four bearers: the
funeral couches were sometimes open and sometimes covered.
Torches were used both at funerals and marriages. The funeral
procession was regulated by a person called <i>Designator</i>, attended
by lictors, dressed in black, with their fasces inverted; sometimes,
also, by the officers and troops, with their spears pointing
to the ground. First, went musicians of various kinds,—then,
mourning women, hired to lament and sing the funeral song;
next came players and buffoons, who danced and sang; one
of them, called <i>Archimimus</i>, supported the character of the
deceased, imitating his words and actions while alive; then
followed the freedmen. Before the corpse were carried images
of the deceased, and of his ancestors, on long poles or frames,
but not of such as had been condemned for any heinous crime,
whose images were broken. Behind the corpse walked the
friends of the deceased in mourning,—his sons with their heads
veiled, and his daughters with their heads bare, and their hair
dishevelled, contrary to the ordinary custom of both; the
magistrates without their badges, the nobility without their
ornaments. The nearest relations sometimes tore their garments,
and covered their hair with dust, or pulled it out; the
women, in particular, who attended the funeral, beat their
breasts and tore their cheeks, although this was forbidden by
the twelve tables. At the funeral of an illustrious citizen the
corpse was carried through the forum, where the procession
stopped, and a funeral oration (<i>laudatio</i>) was delivered in praise
of the deceased from the <i>rostra</i>, by his son, or by some near
relation or friend. The honour of a funeral oration was decreed
also to women, old or young, married or unmarried. From
the forum the corpse was carried to the place of burning or
burial, which the law of the twelve tables ordered to be without
the city,—<i>Hominem mortuum in urbe ne sepelito, neve urito</i>,—according
to the customs of other nations; the Jews, the
Athenians, and others. The Romans prohibited burning or
burying in the city, both from sacred and civil considerations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
and that the air might not be infected. The vestal virgins were
buried in the city, and some illustrious men, which right their
posterity retained, but did not use.</p>

<p>The funeral pile (<i>rogus</i> vel <i>pyra</i>) was built in the form of an
altar, with four equal sides; hence called <i>ara sepulchri</i>, <i>funeris
ara</i>, of wood which might easily catch fire, as fir, pine, cleft
oak, unpolished, according to the law of the twelve tables, <i>rogum
ascia ne polito</i>, but not always so; also stuffed with paper and
pitch, made higher or lower according to the rank of the deceased
(hence <i>rogus plebeius</i>), with cypress-trees set around to prevent the
noisome smell, and at the distance of sixty feet from any house.
On the funeral pile was placed the corpse, with the couch; the
eyes of the deceased were opened; the nearest relations kissed
the body with tears, and then set fire to the pile with a lighted
torch, turning away their faces (<i>aversi</i>) to show that they did
it with reluctance. They prayed for a wind to assist the flames,
as the Greeks did, and when that happened it was thought
fortunate. They threw into the fire various perfumes (<i>odores</i>),
incense, myrrh, cassia, &amp;c.; also cups of oil and dishes (<i>dapes</i>
vel <i>fercula</i>), with titles marking what they contained: likewise
the clothes and ornaments, not only of the deceased, but their
own; every thing, in short, that was supposed to be agreeable to
the deceased while alive; all these were called <i>munera</i> vel <i>dona</i>.
If the deceased had been a soldier, they threw on the pile his
arms, rewards, and spoils. At the funeral of an illustrious commander
the soldiers made a circuit (<i>decurrebant</i>) three times
round the pile, from right to left (<i>orbe sinistro</i>), with their
ensigns inverted, and striking their weapons on one another to
the sound of the trumpet, all present accompanying them, as
at the funeral of Sylla, and of Augustus, which custom seems to
have been borrowed from the Greeks, was used also by the Carthaginians,
and was sometimes repeated annually at the tomb.
As the <i>manes</i> were supposed to be delighted with blood, various
animals, especially such as the deceased had been fond of, were
slaughtered at the pile, and thrown into it; in ancient times,
also men, captives, or slaves, to which Cicero alludes. Afterwards
instead of them, gladiators, called <i>bustuarii</i>, were made to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
fight; so amongst the Gauls, slaves and clients were burnt on
the piles of their masters; among the Indians and Thracians,
wives on the piles of their husbands: thus also, among the
Romans, friends testified their affection; as Plotinus to his
patron, Plautius to his wife Orestilla, soldiers to Otho, Mnester,
a freed-man, to Agrippina.</p>

<p>Instances are recorded of persons who came to life again on the
funeral pile after it had been set on fire, so that it was too late to
rescue them; and of others, who having revived before the pile
was kindled, returned home on their feet. When the pile was
burnt down, the fire was extinguished, and the embers soaked
with wine; the bones were gathered (<i>ossa legebantur</i>) by the
nearest relations, with loose robes, and sometimes barefooted.
We also read of the nearest female relations who were called
<i>funeræ</i> vel <i>funereæ</i>, gathering the bones in their bosom.</p>

<p>The bones and ashes, besprinkled with the richest perfumes,
were put into a vessel called <i>urna</i>, an urn, made of earth, brass,
marble, silver, or gold. Sometimes, also, a small glass vial full
of tears, called by the moderns a <i>lachrymatory</i>, was put in the
urn, and the latter was solemnly deposited in the sepulchre.</p>

<p>When the body was not burnt, it was put into a coffin (<i>arca</i>
vel <i>loculus</i>) with all its ornaments, usually made of stone, as
that of Numa, so of Hannibal; sometimes of Assian stone, from
<i>Asses</i>, or -<i>us</i>, a town in Troas or Mysia, which consumed the
body in forty days, except the teeth, hence called <i>sarcophagus</i>,
which word is also put for any coffin or tomb. The coffin was
laid in the tomb on its back; in what direction among the
Romans is uncertain; but among the Athenians, looking to the
west. When the remains of the deceased were laid in the tomb,
those present were three times sprinkled by a priest with pure
water (<i>aqua pura</i> vel <i>lustralis</i>), from a branch of olive or
laurel (<i>aspergillum</i>), to purify them. Then they were dismissed
by the <i>præfica</i>, or some other person, pronouncing the solemn
word <i>ilicet</i>, i.e. <i>ire licet</i>, you may depart. At their departure,
they used to take a last farewell, by repeating several times <i>vale</i>,
or <i>salve æternùm</i>; adding, <i>nos te ordine, qua natura permiserit,
cuncti sequemur</i>. The friends, when they returned home, as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
further purification, after being sprinkled with water, stepped
over a fire (<i>ignem supergrediebantur</i>), which was called <i>suffitio</i>.
The house itself was also purified, and swept with a certain kind
of broom. There were certain ceremonies for the purification
of the family, when they buried a thumb, or some part cut off
from the body before it was burnt, or a bone brought home from
the funeral pile, on which occasion a soldier might be absent
from duty. On the ninth day after the funeral, a sacrifice was
performed, called <i>novendiale</i>, with which these solemnities were
concluded.</p>

<p>Oblations or sacrifices to the dead (<i>inferiæ</i>, vel <i>parentalia</i>,)
were afterwards made at various times, both occasionally and at
stated periods, consisting of liquors, victims, and garlands;
these oblations were to appease;—to revenge, an atonement was
made to their ghosts.</p>

<p>The sepulchre was then bespread with flowers, and covered
with crowns and fillets: before it, there was a little altar, on
which libations were made, and incense burnt, and a keeper was
appointed to watch the tomb, which was frequently illuminated
with lamps. A feast was added, called <i>silicernium</i>, both for the
dead and the living. Certain things were laid on the tomb,
commonly beans, lettuces, bread, and eggs, or the like, which it
was supposed the ghosts would come and eat; hence <i>cœna
feralis</i>; what remained was burnt; for it was thought mean to
take away any thing thus consecrated, or what was thrown into
the funeral pile. The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves
during their lifetime; if they did not live to finish them,
it was done by their heirs, who were often ordered by the testament
to build a tomb. The highest honours were decreed to
illustrious persons after death. The Romans worshipped their
founder Romulus as a god, under the name of Quirinus.
Hence afterwards the solemn <i>consecration</i> of the emperors, by
a decree of the senate, who were thus said to be ranked in
the number of the gods, also of some empresses: temples and
priests were assigned to them—they were invoked with prayers—men
swore by their name or genius, and offered victims on their
altars.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Goomtie river is very narrow, and a
bridge of sixteen boats is placed across it. At Chandroutī is a
white temple much carved—the platform in the centre of the
stream stands out about two feet high—a bamboo was stuck
upon it, and several birds were perched on the stones. The
ruins of the temple must have fallen into the river I suppose, as
no ruins are there, only a very few stones:—this is to be
lamented. It must have been very picturesque, and it also must
have pointed out the dangerous spot to vessels. The navigation
is perplexing, but we came through it without any mischance,
and, after a great deal of annoyance, anchored at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> off a
village; our time to lugāo the boats has usually been four hours
earlier. The Hindūs, who have had no dinner to-day, must be
sick and weary; we could not get to the bank, on account of
the shallowness of the water until this hour. The Musalmān
crew of the budgerow cook and eat on board; the crews of the
woolāk and cook-boat, being Hindūs, cook and eat on the river-side,
that they may not defile the sacred Gunga.</p>

<p>If you lugāo near a village the chaukidārs come down and
guard your boats; if you anchor on a sandbank you guard
your own boats, and are generally distant from robbers; nevertheless,
care is required through the night, and a watch should
be set on each vessel during the dark hours.</p>

<p>Five miles above Chandroutī is Bullooah ghāt and ferry on
the right bank,—the banks are formed of <i>kankar</i> rock. Exactly
opposite the ferry, the budgerow struck on a sunken bank, which
was very deep in the water; we were detained upwards of two
hours ere she could be got off; the rudder was unshipped by
the manjhī, and after great labour we were once again afloat,
without having sustained much damage. The river is very
shallow, and to find the deep stream is difficult in a budgerow.</p>

<p>“Fifty miles above Ghazipūr, or eight above Bullooah ghāt,
on the right bank of the river, is Kye, and its sunken kankar
reef—scarcely avoidable in some dry seasons. Thence due west
over the right bank you may observe the Benares minarets—distant
nine miles.” A little wind aided us, and we lugāoed at
6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> at Rāj ghāt, Benares. A number of temples and tombs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
with the minarets beyond, looked well in the distance as we
approached; but the smoke of the evening fires on the bank,
and the red glare of the setting sun, rendered all objects indistinct.
I walked to see a tomb on the top of the high cliff a
little below Rāj ghāt; it is enclosed by stone walls in a garden,
and is a handsome monument; many tombs are on the outside
by the ravine. It is a very picturesque spot. Thus closed the
evening at Rāj ghāt.</p>

<p><i>1844, Dec. 5th.</i>—A friend accompanied me this morning to view
Benares, or, as it is more correctly called, Bunarus: nothing
pleases me more than driving about this city,—the streets, the
houses, and the people are so well worth seeing. “A little to eat,
and to live at Bunarus,” is the wish of a pious Hindū; but a
residence at this place is rather dangerous to any one inclined to
violate the laws, as the following extract will testify:—“Kalŭ-Bhoirŭvŭ
is a naked Shivŭ, smeared with ashes; having three
eyes, riding on a dog, and holding in one hand a horn, and in
another a drum. In several places in Bengal this image is
worshipped daily. Shivŭ, under this name, is the regent of
Kāshī (Bunarus). All persons dying at Benares are entitled to
a place in Shivŭ’s heaven; but if any one violate the laws of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
the shastrŭ during his residence there, Kalŭ-Bhoirŭvŭ at death
grinds him betwixt two mill-stones.”</p>

<h3>THE SNAKE-CHARMERS.</h3>

<p><i>6th.</i>—Some of these people came down to the river-side, and
displayed their snakes before the budgerow; they had two boa
constrictors, one of which was of enormous size; the owner
twined it about his neck after the fashion in which a lady wears
her sable boa; the other, which was on the ground, glided
onwards, and the man pulled it back, as it appeared to be
inclined to escape into the water. They had a number of the
cobra di capello, twenty or more, which, being placed on the
ground, reared themselves up, and, spreading out their hoods,
swayed themselves about in a fashion which the men called
dancing, accompanied by the noise of a little hand-drum. The
snake-charmers struck the reptiles with their hands, and the
snakes bit them repeatedly on their hands, as well as on their
arms, bringing the blood at each bite; although the venomous
fangs have been carefully removed, the bite itself must be disagreeable;
nevertheless, the natives appear not to mind it in the
least. There was no trick in the case; I saw a cobra bite his
keeper five or six times on his hand and arm, the man was
irritating it on purpose, and only desisted when he found I was
satisfied that there was no deception. At the conclusion of
the exhibition they caught the cobras, and crammed them all
into <i>gharās</i> (earthen vessels); the boas were carried off in a
basket.</p>

<p>In the evening I walked to a dhrumsāla or alms-house on the
bank of the river, a little above Rāj ghāt; it is situated on the
top of a high flight of steps, and is very picturesque. On the
steps of the stone ghāt below is a gigantic image of Hunoomān,
made of mud, and painted according to the most approved
fashion. The natives were very civil, showing me the way to
different places, and yet the Benares people have a <i>bud nām</i> (bad
name) in that respect, being reckoned uncivil to strangers.</p>

<p>On the steps of the ghāt I met a very savage Brahmanī bull;
the beast was snorting and attacking the people,—he ran at me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
but some men drove him off; there were numbers of them in
the bazār, but this was the only savage one I encountered; the
rest were going quietly from gram-stall to gram-stall, apparently
eating as much as they pleased. The merchants would be afraid
to drive the holy bulls away with violence.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—Quitted Rāj ghāt early, and tracked slowly past
Benares, stopping every now and then to take a sketch of those
beautiful ghāts. The minārs rear their slender forms over the
city, and it is not until you attempt to sketch them that their
height is so apparent, and then you gaze in astonishment at
them, marvelling at the skill that has reared structures of such
height and elegance, and at the honesty of the workmen, who
have given such permanent cement to the stones.</p>

<p>A little farther on is a cluster of Hindū temples of extreme
beauty and most elaborate workmanship, with a fine ghāt close
to them; one of these temples has been undermined by the
river, and has fallen—but not to the ground; it still hangs over
the stream,—a most curious sight. How many temples the
Ganges has engulphed I know not; some six or seven are now
either deeply sunk in, or close to the water, and the next rains
will probably swell the river, and undermine two or three more.
A fine ghāt at the side of these has fallen in likewise.</p>

<p>Above this cluster of falling temples is a very beautiful ghāt,
built of white stone,—I know not its name; but I sketched it
from the boats. It is still uninjured by time, and is remarkable
for the beauty of its turrets, over the lower part of which a
palm-tree throws its graceful branches in the most picturesque
manner. On the top of a small ghāt, just higher than the
river, at the bottom of a long flight of steps, two natives were
sitting, shaded from the sun by a large <i>chatr</i>; groups of people
in the water were bathing and performing their devotions,—many
were passing up and down the flight of stone steps,—whilst
others, from the arched gallery above, were hanging
garments of various and brilliant colours to dry in the sun. On
the outside of some of the openings in the bastions straw mats
were fixed to screen off the heat.</p>

<p>Just above this fine structure, on a small ghāt, a little beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
the minarets, is a gigantic figure in black stone of Bhīm Singh,
a deified giant, of whom it is recorded that he built the fortress
of Chunar in one day, and rendered it impregnable. The giant
is represented lying at full length on his back, his head, adorned
with a sort of crown, is supported on raised masonry; at his
right side is erected a small altar of mud, of conical form,
bearing on its top a tulsī plant; the natives water these plants, and
take the greatest care of them. The tulsī had formerly the same
estimation amongst the Hindūs, that the misletoe had amongst the
ancient Britons, and was always worn in battle as a charm; on
which account a warrior would bind a <i>mala</i> of tulsī beads on his
person. The scene was particularly picturesque; below the ghāt,
on which reposed the gigantic hero, were some native boats;
and near them was a man dipping a piece of cloth embroidered
in crimson and gold into the water; while, with a brilliant light
and shade, the whole was reflected in the Ganges.</p>

<p>A little distance beyond I observed a number of small ghāts
rising from the river, on each of which a similar conical tulsī
altar was erected, and generally, at the side of each, the flag of
a fakīr was displayed from the end of a long thin bamboo. A
man who appeared to be a mendicant fakīr, came down to the
river-side, carrying in one hand a long pole, and in the other
one joint of a thick bamboo, which formed a vessel for holding
water, and from this he poured some of the holy stream of the
Ganges on the little shrub goddess the tulsī.</p>

<p>In the midst of hundreds and hundreds of temples and ghāts,
piled one above another on the high cliff, or rising out of the
Ganges, the mind is perfectly bewildered; it turns from beauty
to beauty, anxious to preserve the memory of each, and the
amateur throws down the pencil in despair. Each ghāt is a
study; the intricate architecture, the elaborate workmanship,
the elegance and lightness of form,—an artist could not select
a finer subject for a picture than one of these ghāts. How soon
Benares, or rather the glory of Benares—its picturesque beauty—will
be no more! Since I passed down the river in 1836 many
temples and ghāts have sunk, undermined by the rapid stream.</p>

<p>The Bāiza Bā’ī’s beautiful ghāt has fallen into the river,—perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
from its having been undermined, perhaps from bad
cement having been used. Her Highness spared no expense;
probably the masons were dishonest, and that fine structure,
which cost her fifteen lākh to rear a little above the river, is
now a complete ruin.</p>

<p>The ghāt of Appa Sāhib is still in beauty, and a very curious
one at the further end of Benares, dedicated to Mahadēo, is still
uninjured; a number of images of bulls carved in stone are on
the parapet of the temple, and forms of Mahadēo are beneath,
at the foot of the bastions.</p>

<p>We loitered in the budgerow for above six hours amongst the
ghāts, which stretch, I should imagine, about three miles along
the left bank of the Ganges.</p>

<p>At the side of one of the ghāts on the edge of the river sat a
woman weeping and lamenting very loudly over the pile of wood
within which the corpse of some relative had been laid; the
friends were near, and the pile ready to be fired. I met a corpse
yesterday in the city, borne on a flat board; the body and the
face were covered closely with bright rose-coloured muslin, which
was drawn so tightly over the face that its form and features
were distinct; and on the face was sprinkled red powder and
silver dust; perhaps the dust was the pounded talc, which looks
like silver.</p>

<p>How soon the young Hindūs begin to comprehend idolatry!
A group of children from four to seven years old were at play;
they had formed with mud on the ground an image of Hunoomān,
after the fashion of those they had seen on the river-side; and
they had made imitations of the sweetmeat (<i>pera</i>) in balls of
mud, to offer to their puny idol.</p>

<p>I was at Benares eight years ago (in November, 1836); the
river since that time has undermined the ghāts, and has done so
much damage, that, in another ten years, if the Ganges encroach
at an equal rate, but little will remain of the glory of the most
holy of the Hindū cities. The force of the stream now sets
full upon the most beautiful cluster of the temples on its banks;
some have been engulphed, some are falling, and all will fall
ere long; and of the Bāiza Bā’ī’s ghāt, which was so beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
when last I visited the place, nothing now remains but the ruins!
Her Highness objected greatly to the desire of the Government,
to force her to live in this holy city: poor lady! her destiny exemplifies
the following saying—“He who was hurt by the <i>bel</i>
(its large fruit falling on his head) went for refuge to the <i>bābūl</i>,
(the prickles of which wounded his feet,) and he that was hurt
by the <i>bābūl</i> fled to the <i>bel</i><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.”</p>

<p>The Rajah of Sattara resides a state prisoner at Bunarus.</p>

<p>A buggy is to be hired at Secrole for four rupees eight ānās a
day, which is preferable to a palanquin: in visiting the city the
better way is to quit your buggy, and proceed in a tānjān, if you
wish to see the curious and ancient buildings to advantage.</p>

<p>I am so much fagged with the excitement of the day, gazing
and gazing again, that I can write no more, and will finish this
account with an extract from the “Directory.” “Benares on
the left bank is considered as the most holy city in India, and is
certainly one of the most handsome when viewed at a distance
on the river, there being such numerous stone ghāts and
temples, some of which cost seventeen lākh of rupees. It is
the residence of some native princes, pensioners of the Hon.
East India Company, but their dwellings are divided into so
many little chambers or pigeon-holes, that the internal part of
the city has the appearance of a mass of mean buildings, piled
up without any regard to order and appearance, and narrow
filthy lanes instead of streets.</p>

<p>“There is a large enclosed mart, called a chauk, which opens
at 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, where trinkets, toys, birds, cloth, and coarse hardware
are exposed for sale. It has a large well in it, and is also a
resort for native auctions. Close to the chauk is the principal
alley or mart for <i>gulbadan</i>, a very fine silk of various patterns
worn by natives as trowsers; also fine caps with tinselled crowns,
and very elegant gold and silver embroidery; also scarfs and
turbans, and pieces for fancy head-dresses. There is likewise a
traveller’s chauk, or native inn, and a large horse mart, where
very fine horses, of the Turkī, Persian, and Cabul breeds are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
procurable,—as high as eight, ten, or fifteen thousand rupees,—that
are brought here by the fruit-carriers, who bring grapes
and pears from those countries. Here are several miniature
painters, and also venders of miniatures on ivory, said to be
likenesses of different native princes, their queens, and nāch
girls; and also true likenesses of native servants in costume,
tradesmen, and beggars. Delhi jewellery of the best gold is
brought on board the steamers by sending for the dealers.
Here is also an old observatory, and two very high and slender
minarets, one of which has a slight inclination; travellers
ascending them are expected to give to the keeper the fee of a
rupee. From their tops is a fine view of the city, the adjacent
country, and the river,—so gratifying a sight should not be passed
over by any traveller. Provisions are procurable; partridges,
quail, and wild ducks of all sorts, are to be obtained. Steamers
remain at Rāj ghāt to take in passengers, to discharge and take
in packages, and to receive coals. The civil and military station
is about four miles inland, direct from Rāj ghāt, where reside
the commissioner, the judge, the magistrates, the collectors, the
general, and all the officers of the native regiments quartered
here, and some European artillery.</p>

<p>“Letters must be sent for to the post-office, as they are not
forwarded, which is very inconvenient. The city is about two
miles long: the natives are very uncivil to strangers. Numerous
fanatics are here, who drown themselves, believing that the
holy Ganga and the city of the most holy secures them eternal
happiness. Benares is from Calcutta, viâ Bhagirathī, 696 miles;
viâ Sunderbands, 984; and by land or dāk, 428. Letters
take four days, banjhīs seven days. Palanquins are procurable
here, but they are infested with vile vermin.”</p>

<p>So much for the “Directory,” from which I differ. So far
from the distant view of the city giving you the best idea of it,—it
is not until you are in the midst of and close to the various
and beautiful ghāts and temples just beyond the minārs that you
can have an idea of the beauty of Benares. The best conveyance
in which to visit and sketch the ghāts is a small boat with
an awning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span></p>

<p>We passed the residence of the Raja of Benares at Ramnagar,
one mile and a half above the city; it is a handsome native
palace.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—Passed <i>Chhotā Kalkata</i>, or Sultanpūr-Benares: it is a
native cavalry station, seventeen miles above Benares on the
left bank of the river. Steamers bring to here occasionally, for a
few minutes, to land passengers. It has a kankarī or rocky
point, that is very awkward for native boats,—as also for
steamers, owing to a narrow channel and strong currents; the
point is off the cavalry stables, which are called Little Calcutta.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Chunar we moored the boats at the request
of the <i>sarhang</i>, as the <i>dandīs</i> wished to go on shore to buy and
sell in the bazār; they carry on a regular traffic at all the
stations up the river, and gain a heavy profit on their Calcutta
lanterns, pankhas, bundles of cane, cheeses, pickles, and
a variety of articles. Chunar is famous for its tobacco,
and the men were anxious to lay in a stock for sale at other
places.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the landing-place, and to the left of
it, is a fine peepul-tree (Ficus religiosa), at the foot of which are
a number of idols in stone, placed in an erect position, supported
by the trunk. A native woman placed some flowers upon the
idols, and poured Ganges water over them from an earthen
vessel (a <i>gharā</i>), which she carried on her head. Another was
performing a religious and superstitious ceremony, called <i>pradakshina</i>,—that
is, she was walking a certain number of times
round and round the peepul-tree, with the right hand towards
it, as a token of respect, with appropriate abstraction and
prayers, in the hope of beautiful offspring. For this reason,
also, the Ficus indica is subject to circumambulation. The same
ceremony is mentioned in the “Chronicles of the Canongate:”
the old sibyl, Muhme, says to Robin Oig, “So let me walk the
<i>deasil</i> round you, that you may go safe into the far foreign land,
and come safe home.” “She traced around him, with wavering
steps, the propitiation, which some have thought has been
derived from the Druidical mythology. It consists, as is well
known, in the person who makes the <i>deasil</i> walking three times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
round the person who is the object of the ceremony, taking
care to move according to the course of the sun.” Near the
peepul-tree was an Hindū temple built of stone, but most
excessively disfigured by having been painted red; and next
to it was a smaller one of white stone. The whole formed a
most picturesque subject for the pencil. Thence I proceeded
to the Fort of Chunar, and walked on the ramparts: the little
churchyard below was as tranquil as ever, but the tombs having
become dark and old, the beauty of the scene was greatly
diminished. The Ganges is undermining even the rock on
which the fortress is built. The birds’-nests, formed of mud,
built under the projections of the black rock on which it stands,
are curious; and on some parts of the rock, just above the
river, small Hindū images are carved. The “Directory” gives
the following account of the place:—“On the right bank, about
four miles above Sultanpūr, is Chunar, an invalid station, with a
fortification, on an isolated rocky hill, which projects into the
river, forming a very nasty point to pass in the rains. It completely
commands the river, and is used as a place of confinement
for state prisoners. There are several detached rocky
hills or stone quarries here. It is a very sickly place, owing to
the heat arising from the stone, which causes fever and disease of
the spleen. This is a great place for snakes. A little above the
fort is a temple: tradition states it to contain a chest, which
cannot be opened unless the party opening it lose his hand,—four
thieves having so suffered once in an attempt upon it. Very fine
black and red earthenware may be purchased here,—such as wine
coolers, which, being filled with water after the bottle is inserted,
and set out in the draft of the hot easterly winds (none other
serves the purpose), in the shade, cools the confined liquor as
much as iceing it: the cooler must be dried daily. Also, red
sandy water-holders or suries, which keep water very cool; black
butter pots, with a casing for water, very neatly finished; and
large black double urns, to contain bread, and keep it moist.
Steamers seldom stop here more than ten minutes.”</p>

<p>The Padshah Begam, the Queen of Ghazee-ood-Deen Hydur,
and Moona Jāh, are in this fortress state prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span></p>

<p>Moored our vessels off Turnbull Gunge. Of all the native
villages I have seen this is the most healthy-looking; it consists
of one very long broad road or street, with houses on each side,
built after the native fashion, but on a regular plan; and on
each side the road a line of fine trees shade the people as they
sit selling their goods in the verandahs of their houses.</p>

<p>The Gunge was built by a Mr. Turnbull, a medical man, who
made a large fortune in India when medical men were allowed
to trade; the place bears his name, and is situated about two
miles higher up the river than Chunar.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—A little beyond Turnbull Gunge is a white mandāp
(temple), on the right bank; the top of the spire has been
broken off, and it stands by a fine peepul-tree. Just in front of
it a bank of hard red mud runs out into the river; the budgerow
ran upon it with such violence that many things in the
cabin were upset; after this little fright we proceeded very well.
The dandīs were particularly miserable on account of the rain;
almost every man had clothed himself in a red jacket; for these
cast-off military jackets they had given a rupee apiece; they were
very proud of them, and afraid of getting them wetted. They
wore below the usual native dhotī—<i>i.e.</i> a piece of linen, in lieu
of trowsers, above which the European red coat had a curious
effect. Anchored on a very fine sandbank in the midst of the
river; here we found a chaukidār under a straw thatch, ready
for vessels.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—“Seven miles above Chunar, on the right bank, is the
village of Kutnac, with rocky bottom and hard lumps of earth
in the river; a little above is a ravine, which is to be avoided by
all boats.”</p>

<p>“Fourteen miles above Chunar is the crossing ferry of the
Benares grand road, and of Kitwa and Bhundoolee to Mirzapūr;
thence to the latter place is a fine road, distance seven miles
and a half by land, and sixteen by water.</p>

<p>“Ten miles above the ferry, and seven below Mirzapūr, on
the left bank, is Bhajoan, with a white tomb and a patch of
kankar in the river, on which many boats are lost: hence the
cantonments of Mirzapūr are visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span></p>

<p>“Mirzapūr, a military cantonment, is two miles below the
city and the civil station: the judge’s, the magistrates’, and
the collector’s offices are one mile below the city. The steamer
stops at the agency ghāt at the lower end of the city. This
place is noted for a cotton mart and cotton manufactory; as likewise
for shell lac, lac dye, and hardware in a small way. Many
boats are here at all seasons. The city is very confined, dirty,
and subject to great sickness: there are two or three very fine
stone ghāts here, and some small temples and minarets: bread,
butter, eggs, mutton, lamb, kid, veal, and fowls, are procurable.
Mirzapūr is from Calcutta, viâ Bhagirathī, 748 miles; viâ
Sunderbands, 1036 miles; and by dāk route, 455. The dāk
takes five days, and banjhī eight days to run. Steamers having
plenty of cargo to land are generally detained here four or five
hours.”</p>

<p>The river has given us some trouble to-day, and we have
grounded many times. The white houses of the Mirzapūr
cantonments stretch along the right bank on a very high cliff;
the church, a very elegant building, was planned by Colonel
Edward Smith,—the spire rises just above the ghāt of the civil
station. The manjhī of our vessel wished to anchor there, but
we pushed on to the city, and lugāoed on the other side the
river, close to a fine house, the residence of the Raja of Ramnager.
We did not like to anchor at the stone ghāt of the
city, on account of the noise, smoke, and heat produced by a
crowd of native boats: this will be pleasant: I can be up <i>top
dāghī</i> (gun-fire) to-morrow morning, and sketch the ghāts. In
the mean time the sandbank by which we are moored is cool,
pleasant, and quiet. Now for English letters!</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—We found we ought to have stopped at the ghāt off
Cantonments, as there bread, butter, meat, &amp;c., could be procured;
but what cared I for such creature comforts when I saw
the ghāts in the early morning? We crossed the river, and I
went out to sketch them. There are two fine ones, built of
stone, that lie close together, and a number of temples are upon
them,—placed at intervals upon the cliff, from the river to the
top of the high bank, and very beautiful they are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span></p>

<p>The first sketch comprehended the ghāts that rise out of the
river; on their steps of stone, multitudes of people, in the gay
attire of the East, were ascending and descending for pūja and
bathing, and to bring water up for domestic purposes; the scene
was particularly animated. On the steps of the ghāt was a
large awning, formed of mats, and supported by bamboos, under
which the natives were sitting and conversing, while it screened
them from the sun. Upon the river-side were several square
platforms erected on four bamboos, with great stones beneath to
support them; and on the top of the poles were large <i>jhāmps</i>—that
is, mats of straw, which protected the people sitting inside
from the rays of the sun; these platforms were used as booths,
and in them sweetmeats were displayed for sale. Half-way up
the cliff were three small temples, with fine trees in the background,
in front of which stretched the high bank along the
side of the Ganges.</p>

<p>The second sketch of the same ghāt was taken half-way up
the cliff; on the right are the three small temples above alluded
to, which form part of a group of singular beauty and varied
form. A large shiwala or temple dedicated to Mahadēo is next
to them, and a smaller, separated only by an archway, adjoins it;
on the portico of the latter a fakīr’s staff and flag were erected.
The branches of fine trees were in the background, the cliffs
were abrupt, and the vessels on the Ganges were in the distance.
In front of the doorway of the larger temple the holy bull, (the
vehicle of Mahadēo,) was <i>couchant</i> on a small ghāt erected for
the purpose.</p>

<p>The third sketch was taken from the top of the cliff looking
up the river: it consists of a large shiwala or temple of Mahadēo,
with a second in front which forms a portico, beneath which
<i>Nandi</i> the holy bull reposes <i>couchant</i>; to the side is the spire of
a temple that rises from below. The Ganges adds to the beauty
of the scene, and some branches of large trees in the background
adorn the temple. No mandāp have I ever seen so elaborately
carved or so beautiful; from the basement to the pinnacle
it is a mass of intricate sculpture, united with great elegance of
design. It is covered with images of the gods, carved in stone.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
A little kid, which had just been offered to the idol, was frisking
about the temple, unconscious of how soon he would be served
up as a feast for the Brahmāns. Kid is eaten by Hindūs at
particular times, and the priests consider the offerings as holy
food.</p>

<p>There is another handsome stone ghāt a little further up the
river, with nine temples upon it; and many are the picturesque
spots along the banks of the Ganges. Mirzapūr is famous for
its manufactory of carpets, which are often sent to England; and
large vessels in hundreds were off the city. We proceeded on
our voyage, and lugāoed at Bindachun.</p>

<p><i>1844, Dec. 11th.</i>—We lugāoed early in the evening four miles
above Mirzapūr at the far-famed Bindachun. The first remarkable
object on approaching the place is the ghāt of the <i>Devī</i>
(goddess) which stands out into the river; it is adorned with
six bastions, which present a very fort-like appearance, and
just above it we moored our boats. Taking an old bearer with
me, whilst our people were preparing their evening meal, I
hastened up to see the famous temple of Bhawānī, the place of
resort of the Thugs, where they meet and take the vows. I
ascended the steps of the ghāt of which there are about eighty,
and very steep; from their summit you enter the bazār. This
is a most curious place, and it is so narrow it can scarcely be
called a street, being not more than six feet in the widest part,
and in many places the breadth does not exceed three or four.
It is lined on both sides with native shops, as thick as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
and paved throughout with flag-stones. The people from the
shops called out to me, “Will you not buy a garland for the
goddess, or a <i>tāgah</i>?” “Will you not buy sweetmeats for
the shrine?” Garlands of fresh flowers were in profusion for
sale.</p>

<h3>THE TEMPLE OF BHAWĀNĪ.</h3>

  <p class="right">Sketched on the Spot and on stone by ‎‏فاني پارکس‏‎</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I encountered a man who happened to be an <i>hajjām</i>, a
cupper and scarifier. Now, in all Eastern stories a personage of
this description appears to be a necessary appendage, and mine,
who was also a barber and an Hindū, offered to show me the
way to the temple of the Devī. The road, which is straight
through the narrow paved alley of the bazār, must be half a
mile or more in length: in time we arrived at the temple; three
flags were flying from an old peepul-tree, and the noise of the
bells which the Brahmāns were tinkling for worship told of the
abode of the goddess. The temple, which is built of stone, is
of rectangular form, surrounded by a verandah, the whole
encompassed by a flight of five steps. The roof is flat, and the
pillars that support it of plain and coarse workmanship. On
the left is the entrance to the Hindū holy of holies. The
Brahmāns begged me to take off my shoes, and said I might
then enter and see the face of the goddess. I thought of the
Thugs, and my curiosity induced me to leave my shoes at the
door, and to advance about three yards into the little dark
chamber. The place was in size so small, that when six people
were in it, it appeared quite full; the walls were of large coarse
stones. The worshippers were turned out of the apartment,
and they gave me a full view of the Devī, the great goddess,
the renowned Bhagwān!</p>

<p>The head of the figure is of black stone with large eyes, the
whites of which are formed of plates of burnished silver: these
glaring eyes attract the admiration of the Hindūs:—“Look at
her eyes!” said one. Thrown over the top of her head,
strings of white jasmine flowers (the double sweet-scented
chumpa) took the place of hair, and hung down to the shoulders.
If you were to cut a woman off just at the knees, spread
a red sheet over her, as if she were going to be shaved, hiding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
her arms entirely with it, but allowing her feet to be seen at the
bottom, making the figure nearly square—you would have the
form of the goddess. The two little black feet rested on a black
rat, at least they called it so, and a small emblem of Mahadēo
stood at the side. Six or eight long chaplets of freshly-gathered
flowers hung from her neck to her feet festooned in gradation,—they
were formed of the blossoms of the marigold, the chumpa, or
white jasmine, and the bright red pomegranate. The figure
stood upon a square slab of black stone. It was about four
feet in height, and looked more like a child’s toy than a redoubtable
goddess. The Brahmān or the Thug, whichever he might be,
(for at this shrine all castes worship,) took a white flower, and
gave it to me as a present for the goddess, at the same time
requesting a rupee as an offering at the shrine. I had no money,
but the old bearer had five paisā (about one penny three farthings),
which he gave to the Brahmān, who said, “This is not
enough to buy a sweetmeat for the goddess!” I made answer,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I give thee all, I have no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though poor the offering be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The man saw it was the truth, and was satisfied. The old
bearer then requested me to hold my sketch-book for a few
moments whilst he went in and put up a prayer: this I did,
and the old man returned very quickly, much pleased at having
seen the Devī.</p>

<p>I sketched the goddess when before the shrine, the Brahmān
holding the lamp for me. Over her head was suspended from
the ceiling an ornament of white flowers, and a lamp like that
in the robber’s cave in “Gil Blas” was also hanging from the
roof. There was also a lamp on the black slab, which had the
appearance of a Roman lamp. Ornaments worn on the wrists
of Hindū women, called <i>kangan</i>, formed of a small hank of red,
or rather flame-coloured cotton, intermixed with yellow, were
offered to the Devī: the Brahmāns put them on her shoulders,
as arms she had none. Why and wherefore the <i>kangan</i> is
offered, I know not. Before a satī ascends the funeral-pile,
some red cotton is tied on both wrists. This may, probably,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
account for the kangan offered to Bhagwān, the patroness of
satīs.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BHAGWĀN.</p>
  <p class="right">Sketched in the Temple and on Stone by ‎‏فاني پارکس‏‎</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I thought of the Thugs, but mentioned not the name in the
temple; it is not wise “to dwell in the river and be at enmity
with the crocodile<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.” In the verandah of the temple were two
massive bells of a metal looking like bronze.</p>

<p>I can fancy terror acting on the Hindoos when worshipping
the great black hideous idol, Kalī Ma, at Kalī-ghāt, near Calcutta;
but this poor stump of a woman, with quiet features, staring
eyes of silver, and little black feet, inspires no terror:—and yet
she is Bhagwān—the dreaded Bhagwān!</p>

<p>The temple was crowded by men and women coming and
going, as fast as possible, in great numbers. The month of
<i>Aghar</i> is the time of the annual meeting; it begins November
15th, and ends the 13th of December; therefore Bindachun
must be full of rascals and Thugs at this present time, who
have come here to arrange their religious murders, and to make
vows and pūja.</p>

<p>This visit to Bindachun interested me extremely; the style of
the temple surprised me; it is unlike any of the Hindoo
places of worship I have seen, and must be of very ancient
date. The pillars are of a single stone without ornament, rough
and rude. Some of the shops in the bazār, like the one on the
right where sweetmeats are sold, are of curious architecture;
stone is used for all the buildings, quarries being abundant in
this part of the country.</p>

<p>The people crowded around me whilst I was sketching the
exterior of the temple, but were all extremely civil: the Brahmāns
and beggars clamoured for <i>paisā</i> (copper coins), but were
civil nevertheless. It is a disreputable neighbourhood: I hope
they will not rob the boats to-night, as all the rascals and murderers
in India flock to this temple at the time of the annual fair,
which is now being held. Having made my salām to the great
goddess, I was guided by the barber to another idol, which he
said was worshipped by very few people. It was a female figure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
very well executed in stone, with four or five figures around it,
carved on the same block. I was much inclined to carry it off;
it is one of the handsomest pieces of Hindū sculpture I have
seen. A few flowers were lying withered before it in the hovel
where it stood, placed there, it may be, by the piety of the
barber. Even my husband was induced to climb the steps of
the ghāt, and to walk through the bazār to the temple, but he
did not enter it. A number of idols were under a peepul-tree in
the bazār; they were a great temptation, but in this high place
of superstition it might be dangerous to carry off a god.</p>

<p>This wandering life is very delightful; I shall never again be
content “to sit in a parlour sewing a seam,” which the old
song gives forth as the height of feminine felicity! Much sooner
would I grope through a dark alley idol hunting—<i>Apropos</i>, by
the idols under the peepul-tree was a satī mound, broken and
deserted, not even a kālsa was there to claim the passing
salām of the Hindū, nor a flower to mark the spot: perhaps
the great goddess draws off the worshippers from the deified
mortal, although all satīs are peculiarly under her protection.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">THE TASHMA-BAZ THUGS.</p>

<p>“Thuggee and Meypunnaism are no sooner suppressed than
a new system of secret assassination and robbery is discovered,
proving the truth of Colonel Sleeman’s remark, that ‘India is
a strange land; and live in it as long as we may, and mix with
its people as much as we please, we shall to the last be constantly
liable to stumble upon new moral phenomena to excite
our special wonder.’ As anticipated, at least one set of new
actors have to be introduced to the public, and these are the
Tashma-baz Thugs.</p>

<p>“The Thugs formerly discovered went forth on their murderous
expeditions under the protection of a goddess, the
Tashmabazes have for their genius a European! Who in England
would be prepared to credit that the thimble-riggers of
English fairs have in India given rise to an association that, in
the towns, bazārs, and highways of these provinces, employs
the game of <i>stick and garter</i> as the lure for victims destined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
be robbed or murdered? Yet this is the simple fact. The
British had hardly gained possession of this territory before the
seeds of the flourishing system of iniquity, brought to light
almost half a century afterwards, were sowed in 1802 by a
private soldier in one of his majesty’s regiments stationed at
Cawnpore. The name of this man was Creagh. He initiated
several natives into the mysteries of the <i>stick and garter</i>, and
these afterwards appeared as the leaders of as many gangs, who
traversed the country, gambling with whomsoever they could
entrap to try their luck at this game. It consists of rolling up a
doubled strap, the player putting a stick between any two of its
convolutions, and when the ends of the strap are pulled, it
unrolls, and either comes away altogether, or is held at the
double by the stick, and this decides whether the player loses or
wins. A game requiring apparently no peculiar skill, and
played by parties cleverly acting their parts as strangers to each
other,—being even dressed in character,—readily tempted any
greedy simpleton to try his luck, and show his cash. If he lost,
he might go about his business; if he won, he was induced to
remain with the gamblers, or was followed, and as opportunity
offered was either stupified with poisonous drugs, or by any
convenient method murdered. Many corpses found from time
to time along the vicinity of the Grand Trunk road, without any
trace of the assassins, are now believed to have been the remains
of the Tashmabazes’ victims; and distinct information has been
obtained from their own members of murders committed by
them. The merest trifle, it seems, was sufficient inducement to
them to commit the crime, there being one case of three poor
grass-cutters murdered by those miscreants in a jungle, merely
for the sake of their trifling personal property. Indeed, these
gangs seem to have been of a more hardened character than any
other yet discovered, for their sole aim was gain, however it
might be secured, without the plea of religious motive which
regulated the proceedings of the other fraternities. Parties of
them used to visit all the chief towns and stations of the
Doab and its neighbourhood, and established themselves in the
thoroughfares leading to the principal cities. Under the guise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
of gamblers, they were often brought to the notice of the
authorities, and subjected to the trifling punishments due to
minor offences; but this was the very thing that lulled suspicion
as to their real character. They were constantly in the
power of many dangerous acquaintances; but these were bribed
to silence out of their abundant spoils. The police almost every
where seem to have been bought over. In the city of Gwalior,
the <i>kotwal</i> got one-fourth of their profits; and in the British
territory, five rupees a day have been paid as hush-money to
the neighbouring <i>thannah</i>. Amongst their friends was the mess
khansaman of a regiment at Meerut, the brother of one of their
chiefs, and an accomplice. Gold and silver coin, and ornaments
of pearl and coral, formed part of the remittances that used to
be sent to their head-quarters at Cawnpore. Indeed, they seem
to have carried on a very safe and lucrative business, until the
magistrates of Boolundshuhr and Cawnpore pounced upon them
in the beginning of this year. Mr. Montgomery followed up
their apprehension by a full report to Government, when the
matter was taken up by the Thuggee Department, the sifting
machinery of which, in the hands of Major Graham, soon
brought to light all the facts necessary to establish that the
gang formed a hitherto unknown class of Thugs.”—<i>Agra
Messenger, Dec. 2, 1848.</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>12th.</i>—One mile above Bindachun are the dangerous granite
rocks of Seebpūr. After a very quiet day and very little difficulty,
we anchored off the village of Bhoghwa, where we were
informed by the chaukidār, that turkeys, fowls, and birds were
abundant.</p>

<p>The exertion of yesterday quite fagged me; I was up and
sketching from six in the morning to eleven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, at Mirzapūr, and
again in the evening at the temple of Bhawānī,—a day of over-fatigue,
but a very agreeable one. How I love this roaming life
on the river, with the power of stopping at any picturesque
spot!—Even tracking against the stream is most delightful to
one who, like Dr. Syntax, is in search of the picturesque. My
husband objects to accompanying me through the bazārs, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
such a crowd collect after me;—he goes along quietly, but with
me it is different:—the moment I stop to sketch, a crowd
collects, and the attendants are obliged to drive them off to
enable me to see the object. I have a great sympathy for Dr.
Syntax, and perfectly comprehend the delight he took even in
a picturesque horsepond. India would have driven him wild;—it
is the country of the picturesque. How I love this life in the
wilderness! I shall never be content to vegetate in England in
some quiet country place.</p>

</div>

<p><i>13th.</i>—After an uninteresting passage with monotonous
scenery, we moored off Poorooā, a village on the left bank.
Wild ducks, geese, and Brahmanī ducks are numerous on the
river-side: it is very cold, so much so that I shall be glad to
retire to rest to keep myself warm.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—No wind—a warmer day, and no difficulty on the river.
Anchored at a bastī (village) about three miles below Sirsya.
The Directory says, “Twenty-eight miles above Mirzapūr, on
the left bank of the river, is Suttamaree. Passengers generally
land in the cold season, and have a walk across the neck of
land in a <span class="allsmcap">W.N.W.</span> direction, two miles wide to Taila, and rejoin
the steamer off that place, she having to go a <i>détour</i> of twenty-one
miles round the point. Two miles above Suttamaree is
Deega-kunkur Spit, with a deep bight.</p>

<p>“Letchyagurree and its ravine on the left bank of the river
is twenty-two miles above Deega, noted for its robbers, when
it was attached to the Oude territories.”</p>

<p>We have now arrived within a very short distance of Allahabad;
I shall be quite sorry to end my voyage, and feel the
greatest reluctance to returning into society.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—“Sirsya is a large cotton mart on the right bank; it is
sixty miles above Mirzapūr and twenty-three miles below
Allahabad, to which place there is a good road. There are
several pakka (brick) houses here, and two very fine tanks at the
back of it, and an old mud fort; thence to Prāg, the river is very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
intricate and shallow. Iron work in a small way can be done
for boats at this place. Turkeys and guinea-fowls abound.”</p>

<p>We passed Sirsya early, and found that the Queen’s 40th regiment
had just quitted the place. No fowls or provisions were to
be had,—the 40th, like a flight of locusts, had devoured every
thing around the spot on which they descended; some hilsā
fish alone were to be procured, and most delicious they proved,—not
only when fresh, but also when cured with tamarinds and
vinegar. There is a house, some temples, and a peepul-tree on
the cliff, that would make a good sketch, if taken looking up
the river a little below the spot. In consequence of the
shallowness of the stream we have had much trouble all day, and
were unable to lugāo until half-past seven <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>—cold and
misty.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—Arrived at Munyah ghāt, on the right bank, at noon,—eight
miles from Prāg. The river is so intricate, and the
navigation so difficult, we shall be a length of time going those
eight miles.</p>

<p>The “Directory” says,—“Allahabad is eighty-three miles
above Mirzapūr; its fort is at the junction of the Ganges and
Jumna. The steamers put up at the Jama Masjid, half a mile
inside the Jumna. The native military cantonments, and the
place where most of the civilians and officers live, are from
three to four miles inland. State prisoners are kept here in the
fort. There is also a large stone pillar, said to have been
erected by Alexander the Great to mark his conquests. This
is the seat of the Sadr Dewanī, or principal court of justice; it
was formerly the seat of the Presidency. Bread, butter, eggs,
beef, mutton, lamb, kids, fowls, pigeons, turkeys, guinea-fowl,
quail, partridge, teal, wild ducks, and wild geese, are procurable
here: Europe shops are at the station, and auctions are held.
About two miles from the ghāt is the chauk or market, where
all sorts of cloth, European and native, are procurable. Shawl-men
board the steamers, if sent for, with every kind of Cashmere
shawl, waistcoating, caps, gloves, socks, and Afghanistān
woollen cloths: as also Delhi jewellers, and manufacturers of
cotton carpeting, of various colours, showy on rooms, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
rather durable. A little beyond the chauk is the native sarā’e,
where beautiful horses are at times to be purchased, of the
Persian, Cabul, and Tūrkī breeds. You must send for your
letters to the post-office.</p>

<p>“The distance from Calcutta, viâ Bhagirathī, is 831 miles; viâ
Sunderbands, 1186; and by dāk route, 504 miles.</p>

<p>“Steamer’s regulated distance is 800 miles. Steamers remain
here three entire days, when they depart on their return, taking
passengers and cargo. Apply to the agent there, or to the
commander, for passage downwards.”</p>

<p>In 1844 the Sadr Board of Revenue and the Criminal and
Civil Court, or Sadr Dewanī, were removed to Agra.</p>

<p>At half-past one, <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, we caught the first sight of the fort
and the telegraph. The flags were flying at the junction of the
rivers, and the road from the sands over the Mahratta Band was
plainly visible. Near Arail, just below the ferry, the river is
intricate; and the passage being difficult, we lugāoed off the
ferry.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—The Fort of Allahabad had an imposing appearance
from the river, and as we approached nearer we observed the
flags flying at the bathing-place in great numbers, although the
fair was not set. It was delightful once again to see old Prāg,
the Jama Masjid, the old well, surmounted by the temple—so
like that of the Sibyl, where dwells the Gossein,—the shrine
of Mahadēo a little above it, our old friend’s bungalow beyond,
and the fine peepul-tree on the high bank of the Jumna, that
almost hides the house and chabūtara, where we had passed so
many years. Our old acquaintances are flocking down to welcome
our return: we are once more at Allahabad, once more lugāoed
in the blue waters of the Jumna, off the steamer ghāt.</p>

<h3>NATIVE SUGAR MILLS.</h3>

<p>The following account of the sugar mills, given me by Major
Parlby, will elucidate the annexed sketch, which was taken by
him on the spot.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="plate47" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/plate47.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE SUGAR MILLS AT BELASPORE.</p>
  <p class="right">Sketched on the spot, and on Stone by Major Parlby.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“As the sugar-cane is usually cultivated all over India, and
the produce of its juice, in some form or other, is universally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
used, and constitutes a valuable article of export from India
when converted into sugar, it may not be out of place to
describe the construction and use of the patriarchal and simple
form of mill represented in the drawing, which is at the village
of Belaspore, on the left bank of the Ganges, near Mirzapore,
about thirty miles below Allahabad.</p>

<p>“It is supposed that sugar has been known and used in
India and China from the earliest ages; and historians say that
it was not introduced into the western world until after the
conquest of Alexander the Great. This construction of mill is
common in many parts of India; and, rude and simple as it
is, it is found to succeed in expressing the juice from the sugar-cane
more perfectly than the rude cylinder mills which are used
in other places. The villagers knew nothing more of its origin
than that their fathers and grandfathers had used the same mills
without alteration, except the occasional renewing and repairs of
the wood-work, as required.</p>

<p>“Some writers,—and amongst the rest, Colonel Sleeman,—in
describing this construction of mill, term it the “Pestle and
Mortar sugar mill:” but this name is improperly applied, for
the vertical beam has no reciprocating up-and-down motion, as
the pestle of a common mortar has, but merely turns round in
the cavity of the bed, as the bullocks walk round in their
circular course. The bed of the mill is formed of a large mass
of stone, of as hard a nature as can be procured in the locality,
and free from any mixture of limestone, on which, probably,
the action of the acid of the expressed juice of the cane might
be injurious.</p>

<p>“The beds are cylindrical, ornamented externally with figures,
emblematical or religious, which are cut in relief.</p>

<p>“The upright beam of the mill is generally selected from a
tree, the wood of which is heavy, hard, tough, and durable;
and for this purpose the trunk of the babūl, which is indigenous
in these parts, is well suited, and is generally chosen.</p>

<p>“The bark is stripped off, one end is rounded, and the other
is cut to a point; the rounded end works in the hollow bed of
the mill, and on the pointed end is hitched the end of a stay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
properly formed for the purpose, the other end of which is
attached to a horizontal beam, generally formed from a strong
crotched piece of wood, which is cut at the crotched end to fit
into a groove cut on the outside of the bed in which it traverses
round, and the bullocks are yoked to the end of this beam.
The stay leading from the top of the vertical beam is generally
made of two pieces, which are capable of adjustment, so that
the horizontal beam to which the bullocks are yoked may be
kept at a proper distance from the ground.</p>

<p>“The short pieces of cane, as they are supplied by a native,
are bruised and squeezed against the internal sides of the mortar
as the vertical beam moves round, the expressed juice running
off by the channel which is cut from the bottom, opposite to
which is an earthen pan let into the ground to receive it, a small
piece of bamboo generally serving to connect them.</p>

<p>“The driver sits on a frame or seat upon the end of the
horizontal beam, his own weight increasing the bruising power
of the mill, which is also assisted by adding a weight of stones,
if necessary. As the process of bruising the cane takes place
in the cold season, in December, the driver sometimes keeps
himself warm by a pan of hot embers placed on the frame.</p>

<p>“To each of these mills at Belaspore there were six bullocks,
forming three reliefs: they work night and day as long as the
cane is cutting, three hours at a time; and in three hours about
four seer or eight pounds of juice are expressed. The juice,
as the pan fills, is immediately taken to the hut, whence the
smoke is seen escaping at the door; and there, in a boiler fixed
on a rude furnace, the process of boiling the juice to concentrate
it is carried on; it is boiled down until it becomes a substance
called goor, much thicker than treacle; and in this state is
carried to the neighbouring market of Mirzapūr, where it is sold
at the rate of eighteen seer for the rupee. Sixteen seer, or thirty-two
pounds of goor are obtained from one maund of cane
(eighty pounds).</p>

<p>“In the foreground of the sketch are three heaps of sugar-cane,
cut into pieces of six or eight inches long, ready to be supplied
to the mill. A native carries the pieces of sugar-cane in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
basket, and charges the mill by occasional supplies, as represented
in the drawing; and he also takes out the bruised cane,
from which the juice has been sufficiently expressed, and carries
it to the hut, to assist, with a mixture of oplā (dried cow-dung)
in making the fire for the boiling process. The sugar-cane is
slightly wetted when put into the mill, about two pints of water
being used to moisten about eighty pounds’ weight of it. The
goor is purchased by the sugar-refiner, who dissolves and refines
it again in the process of making sugar. But goor is also used
for several purposes,—as in preparing tobacco for smoking, and
by masons, to mix with lime in forming hard cements for floors,
terraces, baths, &amp;c., for which the Indian masons are celebrated.</p>

<p>It is impossible to contemplate the scene in the drawing
without being struck with the strong contrast it bears to any
mechanical process in our own country. The sketch was taken
from life, and there was a quietude and apathy in all the persons
engaged, which was remarkable: even the bullocks are
urged round at a very slow pace, hardly two miles an hour, by
the voice, more than by the short whip occasionally used by the
driver. Thus it is ever in climates where the necessaries of life,
shelter, food, and clothing are cheap, and easily procured; in
more severe climates the expenses attendant on the social state
call forth the more active energies of human nature. ‘God
gives sugar to him who eats sugar<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>,’—<i>i.e.</i> He provides for His
creatures in proportion to their wants.”</p>

<p><i>1844, Dec. 18th.</i>—The whole day was employed in receiving
visits from our old acquaintances at the station, the mūnshī, the
<i>’amala</i> of the office, and the natives whom we formerly employed.
The pleasure they testified at our return was very gratifying; and
the delight of Lutchman, my old <i>Barha’ī mistree</i> (carpenter), was so
genuine, it brought tears from my eyes, as well as from his own.
We have moored the boats just below an old būrj (bastion) of
the ancient city of Prāg; there is a gateway below,—the water-gate,
perhaps, of the old Fort: the Sibylline temple crowns it.
The old gossein who lives in the temple came this evening to
make salām; he reminded me of my having given him a present
of sixteen rupees for having aided in recovering two hundred,
that had been stolen from me; he was young, and good-looking
then, now he is old and wily: he brought his son, a fine young
Brahmān, to introduce to me. Many are the strange stories
related respecting this old Brahmān and his solitary temple; and
I have before mentioned its curious resemblance to that of the
Sibyl. Having defended the truth and faithfulness of my pencil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
in England, I was glad of an opportunity of again particularly
observing the Ionic style of architecture of this little building;
and while pondering on its singular appearance, Colonel Edward
Smith came on board, and solved the mystery by mentioning
that General Ouchterlony, finding the Jama Masjid seldom used
as a place of worship, took possession of it as his dwelling-place,
and formed magnificent rooms between the arches. He built
the temple of the Sibyl on the top of the ancient water-gate of
the old city. The Muhammadans, some years afterwards,
petitioned Government not to allow the mosque to be used as a
dwelling-place; it was therefore restored to them, and is now
used as a masjid.</p>

<p>A pretty little modern building,—a small temple, dedicated to
Mahadēo, is near the ancient well of the water-gate.</p>

<p>I am quite fatigued with seeing old faces, and saying kind
words to the poor people. To my surprise an old woman, with
a basket full of worsted balls, came to make salām; she was
fat and well,—I had left her a poor wretched creature; she
used to make worsted balls for my dog Nero to fetch and carry.
How many ānās a month the poor old woman got from Nero;
she used to throw her ball to the dog, and then come to ask for
payment; she was in fact a pensioner. The beautiful dog is
dead; and the wretched old hag is fat and well, and makes
worsted balls as usual. She got her little present, and went off
quite happy.</p>

<p>The ghāt off which we are moored has been recently made by
the Steam Agency; and just above is an hotel, which has been
established for the convenience of the passengers from the
steamers, and is well conducted by Mr. Berrill. This little
hotel on the banks of the Jumna-jee is well described in the
following curious lines, which were written in four languages on
the window of an inn in Russia.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—We quitted the boats, and went up to stay with our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
friends, Mr. and Mrs. M⸺; they received us with all that
kindness and hospitality for which India is renowned; their
bungalow, a very fine one, is well situated at the other end
of the station. We met a barouche drawn by two camels,
harnessed like horses; they went along at a fine pace, and I
envied the possessor that pair of well broken-in carriage camels:
in double harness they look well; in single harness,—especially
in a Stanhope, or any other sort of buggy,—the animal appears
too large for the carriage.</p>

<p><i>1845, Jan. 11th.</i>—Saw a small comet, the nucleus of which
was more distinct than that of the immense comet I saw when
at sea, although the tail was so small, that it looked not unlike
the thin switch tail of a horse.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Finding it necessary to remain up the country for a
time, we dug a tank and made a house for the wild ducks, and
turned sixty-five birds into it. It was amusing to see the delight
with which the <i>murghabīs</i> splashed into the water when freed
from the baskets in which they had been brought from the
jangal, and such a confabulation as there was amongst them!</p>

<p>I omitted to mention that during my former residence at this
station, the jamadar came to tell me that a <i>murdār-khor</i> (an
eater of carrion), who had lately arrived, was anxious to perform
before us. The man did not ask for money, but requested to
have a sheep given him; he said he would eat the whole at one
meal, body and entrails, leaving only the horns and the skin,
which he wished to carry away; the wretch said that he would
kill the sheep by tearing open its throat with his teeth, and would
drink the blood. This feat they told me he had performed before
in the bazār. I saw the man at a distance, and was so much
disgusted that I ordered him to be turned out of the <i>compound</i>
(the grounds around the house). In Colonel Tod’s “Travels in
Western India” there is a most interesting account of the
<i>murdi-khor</i>, or man-eaters; he made an attempt to visit the
shrine of Kalka, the dread mother, whose rites are performed
by the hideous <i>Aghori</i>, whose patroness she is, as <i>Aghoriswara
Mata</i>. At one time they existed in those regions, but were only
found in the wildest retreats, in the mountain-cave, or the dark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
recesses of the forest. Colonel Tod saw a man perform pūja
at the shrine of Goraknāth, whom he had every reason to
believe was one of these wretched people,—but whether he was
a murdi-khor he could not determine; although, as he went off
direct to the Aghori peak, said to be frequented only by his sect,
it is probable that he belonged to the fraternity. It appears
that the <i>murdār-khor</i> (the carrion-eater) is almost the same as
the <i>ādam-khor</i> or cannibal.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—This life is very monotonous, and the only variety I
have is a nervous fever now and then.</p>

<p><i>March 1st.</i>—During a visit at the house of a friend I received
a kharīta from her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī, and was greatly
pleased to see the signature of the dear old lady, and also felt
much flattered by her remembrance. After I quitted Allahabad
for England her Highness remained there some time; at last, on
her positive refusal to live at Bunarus, it was agreed that she
should reside at Nassuk, a holy place, about one hundred miles
from Bombay. She quitted the Upper Provinces, marched
across the country, and established herself at Nassuk. Having
heard from some of her people of my return to India, and
arrival at Prāg, her Highness did me the honour to write to me,
and after the usual compliments with which a native letter
always commences, the Bāiza Bā’ī added, “I received your
letter in which you acknowledged the receipt of mine; but I
have not since heard from you, and therefore beg you will write
and tell me how you and the sāhib are; do not be so long again
without writing, because it makes me anxious.”</p>

<p>I sent in answer a letter of thanks to her Highness for her
kindness in having borne me in remembrance; it was written by
a mūnshī in the Persian character, and enclosed in a kharīta.
At the same time I sent a bunch of the most beautiful artificial
flowers to the Gaja Raja, to testify my respect; it would have
been incorrect to have sent the flowers to the Bā’ī. They were
Parisian, and remarkably well made; the Gaja Raja, being fond
of flowers, will be pleased. I gave the letter and bouquet to
one of her attendants, Bulwunt Rāo, who promised to send
them across the country to Nassuk. The title of <i>Gaja</i>, <i>i.e.</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
elephant, is curiously applied to the young Princess, her form
being fragile, delicate, and fairy-like.</p>

<p>In 1848 I received a letter from a friend at Gwalior, mentioning
that the Chimna Raja, the daughter of the Gaja Raja
Sāhib, who was born at Allahabad, and who was then about
eight years of age, had been betrothed by her great grandmother,
the Bāiza Bā’ī, to Jhankī Rāo, the Maharaj of Gwalior; after
which ceremony the young bride returned to Oojein with the
ex-Queen. This intelligence pleased me greatly, because the
marriage of the great grand-daughter of Dāolut Rāo Scindia with
the reigning sovereign of the Mahrattas will give great satisfaction
to her Highness; and the wandering Hājī rejoices that
her great grand-niece (by courtesy) will share the throne of her
ancestors with the Maharaj of Gwalior.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—This evening, while cantering at a sharp pace round
the Mahratta Bandh, my horse fell, and my companion thus
described the accident in a letter to his brother. “Kābul came
down upon his nose and knees; nineteen women out of twenty
would have been spilt. The Mem Sāhiba sat her horse splendidly,
and pulled him up like a flash of lightning. The infernal
brute must have put his foot in a hole. The evening passed
hearing music, and talking philosophy.”</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—I was invited to spend the day at Sultan Khusrū’s
garden, to which place a tent had been sent, which was pitched
under the fine tamarind trees in a most picturesque place. The
garden is a large space of ground, enclosed by a high wall,
containing tombs and some very fine trees: the entrance is
through a lofty gateway. There are three tombs, and a <i>Baithak-khāna</i>
or pavilion. The first and largest monument is that of
Sultan Khusrū, in which he is buried; it is a handsome building,
and within it is deposited a beautifully illuminated kurān, which
the dārogha showed us with great pride. Sultan Khusrū
married a daughter of the Wuzeer Azim Khan; he was the son
of Jahāngīr, and his mother was the daughter of the Rajpūt
Prince Bagwandas of Amber. The next monument is that of
the Jodh Bā’ī, but in honour of which lady of that name I
know not. Akbar married a Jodh Bā’ī, the daughter of Oodi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
Singh, of Jodpoor; she was the mother of Jahāngīr, and was
buried on the <i>Chand-maree</i>, near Fathīpūr Sicri. Jahāngīr
married a Jodh Bā’ī, the daughter of Rae Singh, of Bickaner;
she was the mother of Shāhjahān, and her tomb is at Secundra.
I forget to whose memory the tomb in Sultan Khusrū’s <i>bāghīcha</i>
(<i>garden</i>) was erected.</p>

<p>There is also a third mausoleum, which is not so handsome as
the two before mentioned; and the fourth building is a pavilion,
in which visitors are allowed to live for a short time during a
visit to the garden. Around the tombs are some of the largest
tamarind trees I ever beheld: the <i>imlī</i>, as the natives call the
tamarind tree, is one of the finest and most beautiful in the
world; and they are generally found around or sheltering the
tombs of revered or sacred characters. The sherbet prepared
from the fruit is excellent; the leaves and fruit are used medicinally.
The natives are impressed with a notion that it is
dangerous to sleep under the tamarind tree, especially during
the night; grass or vegetation of any kind is seldom seen growing
in such situations, and never with luxuriance. In times of
scarcity the seeds are eaten by the poor; they resemble a common
field bean.</p>

<p>Part of Sultan Khusrū’s garden has been cultivated English
fashion, that is, for vegetables; seeds are given to the <i>mālīs</i>,
(gardeners), and rewards for the first, second, third, and fourth
best <i>dālī</i>—that is, basket of vegetables: this is good; the
highest prize is fifty rupees, which will be to natives worth the
contest. The mālī in charge, kneeling on one knee, presented
me with a bouquet of flowers; it was not ungracefully done,—nevertheless,
it was bad taste to teach a man an European style
of reverence, which in gracefulness is far inferior to the salām
of the native.</p>

<p>The sarā’e (caravansary), with its gateways, and the handsome
one through which you pass to the garden, are well worth
visiting; on the doors of the latter a number of horse-shoes are
nailed for good luck, and the variety in shape and size is so
great it is absolutely curious.</p>

<p>Just beyond the gates of the sarā’e is a <i>bāolī</i>, a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
well, with underground apartments; it is a most remarkable
and curious place, and the well is a noble one. The top of the
bāolī is level with the ground, from which place water can be
drawn up, as also from the underground apartments, which
open on the well. You descend by a long broad flight of stone
steps to the water’s edge, where there is an arch, ornamented
with two large fish, the arms of Oude. Half way down is a
pathway of stone that juts out from the wall, and communicates
with the third apartment, from which you ascend by small
circular staircases to the top. A nervous person might object
to the walk along the pathway, it being very narrow, and having
no defence—no parapet on the inner side. Parties of natives
resort here during the hot winds, and spend the hours in the
coolness of the bāolī.</p>

<p><i>March 15th.</i>—Hired a large bungalow of a very respectable
native for eighty rupees a month, garden included, and removed
into it.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—My husband received permission from Government to
visit England on furlough. A friend quitted us for the up-country
in a palanquin placed on a truck, and drawn by a tattoo
(a pony), with relays on the road. In former times a palanquin
was always carried by bearers,—by the present method a dāk
trip is performed much more quickly than it was formerly by
relays of natives.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—The other day a native was brought before Mr. R.
M⸺, the magistrate of Allahabad, charged with the murder of
his wife and daughter. The man confessed to having cut their
heads off with his sword; he said he had reason to believe his
wife unfaithful, therefore he killed her; and as he supposed the
magistrate would <i>murder</i> him for the act, and, as in that case,
his young daughter would have no one to marry her, and would
be obliged to beg her bread, he killed her also. “But,” said he
to Mr. M⸺, “beware how you <i>murder</i> me for having killed my
wife. If the women find their husbands are hung for killing
them should they be unfaithful, what man will be safe?” I
know not the name of the frail fair one who fell a sacrifice to
jealousy; doubtless it was soft and pleasing, for although her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
husband did not attend to the words of the Hindū sage, who
says, “Strike not even with a blossom a wife guilty of a hundred
faults!” still, in all probability, her parents bestowed an harmonious
name upon her, in obedience to the directions of Menu,
who suggests that “the names of women should be agreeable,
soft, clear, captivating the fancy, auspicious, ending in long
vowels, resembling words of benediction.” He also says, “Let
<i>mutual fidelity</i> continue to death: this, in few words, may be
considered as the supreme law between husband and wife.”
The conjugal duties of the Rajpūts are comprehended in that
single text.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—When I was formerly at Allahabad the Bāiza Bā’ī was
anxious to have leave from Government to erect a most remarkable
pillar of stone, that was prostrate in the Fort, near the
gateway. This lāt, as before mentioned, is covered with inscriptions
in unknown characters, that puzzle the learned. The
design of her Highness was not carried into execution, and the
lāt was afterwards erected in the Fort at the expense of the
Asiatic Society, by Colonel Edward Smith, C.B. We drove to
see it in the evening, admired it very much, and thought it
erected with great judgment: it is highly ornamental to the
Fort. Whilst we were examining the pillar, the buggy horse
took fright, became very violent, upset five of the small stone
pillars that support the chains that surround the lāt, and broke
his harness in divers places. The scene was good.</p>

<p><i>April 1st.</i>—I fell by accident on the stones in the verandah
with considerable force, and fainted away; the blow which I
received on my left shoulder was severe; painful and useless my
arm hangs by my side,—I have no power to move a finger.</p>

<p>The oriental proverb, that “A sharp sword will not cut raw
silk<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>,” does not apply to silk when manufactured; as I this
morning saw a gentleman place a silk handkerchief upon his
sword, and, with one skilful drawing cut, divide it exactly and
diagonally.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Divine service was performed in the new church, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
has been erected at Allahabad at the expense of the inhabitants;
it formerly took place in the Circuit Bungalow, or in the Fort.
The church is a very handsome one, and the internal arrangements
are good.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—About 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a tufān came on,—rain in torrents, with
heavy hail,—dust in whirlwinds; in the course of a quarter of
an hour the thermometer fell ten degrees, from 88° to 78°.
It was fine to witness such a commotion. The roof of our
house was under repair,—streams of water came pouring into
every room from all parts of the roof, until the house was full of
it; much damage was done to the pictures; and we were obliged
to quit the place, and take refuge at the house of a friend.</p>

<p><i>May 11th.</i>—The ice-pits opened, the allowance to each subscriber
eight seer per diem,—about sixteen pounds’ weight daily.
The thermometer is 89°. There being no wind, the tattīs are
useless, and in spite of the thermantidote the heat is overpowering;
we begin to long for the fresh breezes of England; I
shall rejoice when we are on board a good vessel and out at sea
again.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—About half-past 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the moon was almost completely
eclipsed, and the night was so dark I could not see the
way as I was driving home. The natives were making offerings
of rice, fruit, vegetables, &amp;c., to restore the light quickly, and
to ward off impending calamities.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—A tufān or a storm of dust blew furiously at night,
succeeded the next morning by heavy rain, thunder, and lightning;
the day after it was oppressively hot,—another storm
cleared the atmosphere, and the thermantidote became quite
delicious, it poured in such a volume of cold air.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Went to the Bandh in the evening, but soon returned;
the air was so hot, it was like breathing liquid fire.</p>

<p><i>June 1st.</i>—The heat in church was so oppressive, I will not
venture there again; pankhas and thermantidotes are in full
play during the time of Divine service,—but even with their
aid in cooling the air, the heat is intolerable.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—The rains appear to have set in, accompanied with
thunder and lightning. The darkness was so great to-day at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> that we were obliged to dine by lamp-light; the evening is
dull and heavy, the rain is falling in torrents, and the darkness
is relieved at intervals by forked lightning; the thunder is
distant.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—Very hot during the day, and very oppressive; this
damp heat is worse for the health than the dry heat of the hot
winds. Heard with regret of the death of Mr. James Gardner,
at Khāsgunge.</p>

<p><i>July 8th.</i>—Engaged a fourteen-oared pinnace, a woolāk of
900 mŭns, a pataila of 600, and a small cook-boat, to take us
down to Calcutta.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—We quitted dear old Prāg at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> under heavy rain
and a contrary wind. I bade adieu to a place in which I had
spent so many happy days with much sorrow, and without any
prospect of ever revisiting the spot.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Anchored at Rāj ghāt, Benares: the ghāts have lost
much of their picturesque beauty from the height of the
river, the water having covered the steps. The Hindū temples
that have partially fallen merely show their spiral domes above
the waters; and the Ganges is as full of mud as a river may
well be; the water is quite thick, of a muddy colour, and a
small quantity in a tumbler gives a most marvellous sediment.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—A heavy wind against us; the waves were so high on
the Ganga, and the boats rolled so violently, that the natives on
deck were quite overcome by sea-sickness, and I was also suffering
from <i>mal de mer</i>.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Picked up a large heavy chest afloat from some wreck.
It contained fifty boxes of G. Davis’ Chinsurah cheroots, and
was marked Jan Mahomed Shah, in the Persian character: the
cheroots were all destroyed from having been in the water. Soon
afterwards we picked up another chest of the same size and description,
with the bottom stove in; also a box of cigars that
was floating by the side of it, evidently from the same wreck.
Lugāoed off the bāstī of Tipperiah, in the midst of an expanse
of water. About 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the strong easterly wind, which had
been blowing all day, veered and sunk; a deep silence fell
around—the whole canopy of heaven was covered with a pall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
of black clouds: there was not a gleam of light excepting on
the horizon in one part, where there was one low gleam of
whitish pale light, in form like a bow. The muddy colour of
the interminable river assumed an inky blackness, and united
with the horizon all around: a few minutes afterwards the light
on the horizon disappeared, and all was intense darkness,—a
rushing sound then arose, and the rain fell in torrents, the
drops were of great size, it more resembled the fall of sheets of
water; soon afterwards the lightning blazed over the river, and
some peals of thunder like the roar of cannon and the sharp
discharge of fire-arms, added to the stormy scene. During this
time the wind rose, and suddenly changed to the opposite quarter
of the heavens. I made the dandīs look well to their moorings,
as we were fastened on a wet field, covered by the river, so that
there was a fear the bamboos would be torn out of the wet
earth by the force of the wind acting on the vessel, and that she
would be carried down the fierce stream; however, she stood it
well, being in rather slack water, therefore I went to bed and
slept quietly through the gale, after I had sufficiently enjoyed
the first part of it.</p>

<p><i>August 1st.</i>—The rock of Dolepaharry, with its temple and
beautiful trees standing far distant inland and of very great
height, was a beautiful object—it is near Janghīra—the latter
rock sank into insignificance and appeared very low, in consequence
of the height to which the Ganges had risen. The
whole country is overflowed—the river appears like one vast
sea with a number of fine trees in it—their trunks rising out of
the water, and the earth completely hidden.</p>

<p>Passed Sultangunge and anchored on a wet bank, just on the
entrance of that branch of the river that leads to Bhagulpūr.
The Hindūs must go without their dinners to-night; they will
not cook on board, and in the wet swamp they cannot make a
fire: this is a wretched anchorage, and here comes the rain in
torrents again. Stolen goods cannot be digested, or never
thrive, and so it proved with a boy employed to pull the pankha.
He stole a great quantity of Indian corn; it was not ripe, but
of full size; abounding in milk, sweet, and tempting to eat when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
raw; but when fried in butter, with pepper and salt, it is delicious.
In spite of the caution given by an old havildār, to whom the
field belonged, the boy ate a great quantity—his body swelled,
he became in great pain, and is now ill with fever.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—Last night the distant roar of the waters as they
rushed past the rocks of Colgong lulled me to sleep. This
morning, about 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, we came up to the rocks, the
stream was rushing past at a fearful rate, and forming very large
and powerful whirlpools. Two large patailas were on before
us; the first was twirled round by the eddy and carried back
against the other; they became entangled, and both were carried
back with great velocity for about three hundred yards. Our
pinnace was flying along aided by the cars on board, and also
by the towing of her little boat; but the powerful eddy turned the
vessel straight across the stream, and there she was stopped,
the eddy pulling one way and the men the other—just at this
moment an immense pataila of about two thousand mŭns,
heavily laden with gram, was coming down upon us with full
force, borne on by the violent stream; it was a disagreeable
sight, it appeared as if the shock must sink the pinnace: fortunately
a woolāk was between us and the monster vessel; she
came with great force first upon the woolāk, and drove her against
the pinnace in front of herself; the pinnace reeled with the
shock, but it saved us greatly, and the large vessel, disengaging
herself from us, went on shoving our stern right round in her
impetuous course. I ran on deck, having a dislike to be drowned
in a cabin, but escaped with only a fright. The dandīs recommenced
their exertions, and in a short time we were out of the
eddies and whirlpools around the rocks, and in calm water.
Colgong is very beautiful, both during the rains and the cold
weather, and this is perhaps the most beautiful part of the Ganges.
At 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> passed the Terīyāgalī Hills. The dandīs say there are
fine ruins in the jangal on the largest hill, but no road to them;
and they speak of the immense doorways—entrances; I should
like to explore the place.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—At 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> passed Nuddea, eighty-two and a half
miles from Calcutta; at this spot the Jellingee unites with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
Bhagirathī, and they flow forward under the name of the
Hoogly: the tide is perceptible at Nuddea, it just comes
so far.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Anchored at Nyaserai to prepare anchors for the tide,
which detained us one hour and a half. Nyaserai is on the
entrance of the old Damooda river, over which there is a light
iron suspension bridge. An Up-country boy who was pulling
the pankha told me it made his blood run cold to see the people
crossing on such a slight bridge; that his father had never
visited Calcutta, nor he himself, but that his grandfather had
made the voyage. He was charmed with some Ooria singers
on the bank, and thought they would make their fortunes if
they were to visit Prāg:—what a budget of wonders the boy
will have to unfold on his return to the Up-country! Moored
off the residence of a friend at the powder-works at Eeshapūr.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Arrived in Calcutta—anchored off Prinsep ghāt, from
which place you have a fine view of the river and of the shipping,
all the large vessels lie just off the ghāt. Visited the
“Madagascar” and the “Essex” in the evening.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Took our passage to England in the “Essex;” the
price of the larboard stern cabin on the poop was 2500 rupees,
for ourselves, an ayha, and my curiosities.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Having settled all our affairs we came on board; fortunately
the ship will not sail until to-morrow—I am killed with
fatigue.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Sept. 1st.</i>—At 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, while we were in tow of the steamer,
the “Essex” ran upon a sandbank; she fell over very disagreeably
on her side, was thus carried by the violence of the
tide over the obstacle, and righted in deep water; the accident
broke the hawsers that united the two vessels. After some
little difficulty and much delay we proceeded on our voyage.
The pilot was much surprised, as a fortnight before that part
of the river was all clear; he said we had run upon the end of
the tail of the “James and Mary” sandbank, which had become
lengthened, and he despatched a notice thereof to Calcutta.
Where the Hoogly is joined by the Roopnarrain at Hoogly
Point, a very large sheet of water is formed, but it has many
shoals; and as it directly faces the approach from the sea, while
the Hoogly turns to the right, it occasions the loss of many
vessels, which are carried up the Roopnarrain by the force of
the tide. The eddy caused by the bend of the Hoogly has, at
this place, formed a most dangerous sand, named the “James
and Mary,” around which the channel is never the same for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
week together, requiring frequent surveys. The Bore commences
at Hoogly Point. The musquitoes were very troublesome;
we found it cooler than on shore, but nevertheless very
hot.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>—Passed Mud Point, and felt rather nervous on the
occasion; the heat was intense, and there was not a breath of
air. Employed myself writing farewell letters to friends in India,
which were sent to Calcutta by the Saugor dāk boat. This
evening the tide ran with such violence that after the vessel had
anchored, it was necessary for a man to remain at the helm.
This steering an anchored vessel had a curious and novel effect.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—The pilot quitted us at the Sandheads, and took my
husband’s official letters with him. A calm came on, and we
were just preparing to anchor again, when a breeze sprang up
and carried us out to sea.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—A number of native sailors (<i>khalāsīs</i>) came down the
river with us to assist the men on board the “Essex.” Seven
of the English sailors are ill from fever; no marvel with extra
grog and hard work under such a terrific sun: the musquitoes
and prickly heat alone, are enough with such intense heat to
bring on fever.</p>

<p>I saw a waterspout—it commenced like a great funnel hanging
from a dark cloud that was the basis of a fine white one: the
point of the funnel having descended about half way attracted
the sea-water, which bubbled and rose up in a point until it
united with the end of the spout; having accomplished this
union, the spout thickened, and became of the same size from
the top to the bottom. After a time it appeared to become
lighter, for it bent with the wind and formed a slight curve. The
spout became still less and less, and eventually so thin that the
wind carried it along almost horizontally. It appeared to sever
from the sea, and having become as thin as a ribbon, disappeared.
It was of a dull rainy colour—some bright blue sky was above
the white cloud formerly mentioned, and the whole had a
vapoury appearance.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—The weather cooler; for the last few days we have had
heavy squalls, accompanied with thunder, lightning, and rain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
in torrents. Ill from <i>mal de mer</i>: I know not when I have
suffered so severely; the ship has a cargo of sugar, which is
packed in hides: the rain has fallen in torrents, in sheets of
water, as rain only falls, I think, in the bay of Bengal, a perfect
deluge:—the hatches having been closed in consequence, a
horrible effluvium has ascended to the cuddy: how people can
live below deck is a miracle, in the heat and steam of those
sweating hides! fortunately, no passengers are below, and
sailors, poor fellows, endure and shrink not. An huppoo was
seen to-day making its way to the ship, but weary from its long
flight, and overpowered by the strong squall, it sank in the
waters screaming. A flying-fish came on board, and one of the
most elegantly-formed birds I ever saw, which they called a
whale-bird, was caught in the rigging; its head beautifully
marked, the body slight, its slender and powerful wings very
long.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—Off Madras.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>—Opposite Centinel Island in the Andamans,—very
little wind. It is remarkable, with the exception of a few
squalls, how calmly we have come down the Bay; at this time
of the year we expected to encounter fierce weather. The
weather still hot, although very different from what it was
before,—nevertheless it renders any exertion a great toil.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—The moonlight evenings on the poop are beautiful.
A fine breeze, with a steady ship; she is deeply laden, goes on
quietly and steadily, and seldom rolls at all. What a contrast
to that wretched “Carnatic!” <i>Apropos</i>, I am told she was condemned
in Calcutta as not sea-worthy; therefore I had a good
escape in her.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—We are anxious to get to the western side of the Bay,
but the winds force us in a contrary direction; we are near the
Nicobars, running down the side of the islands. I should like
to go on shore to see Lancour, and the rest of my friends, the
Carnicobar-barians, once more.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>—To-day we are only fifty miles from the great Nicobar,
and shall soon get away from the islands, which will be pleasant;
should a squall come on their vicinity is to be avoided. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
“Essex” has been very unfortunate this voyage: in coming out
she lost her captain at the Cape; in Calcutta she lost her third
mate, the cook, and six seamen. The property of the deceased
seamen will be sold by auction on deck this evening.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—We have passed the Great Nicobar, and are on a
level with Acheen Point. The vessel is going steadily through
the water about six knots an hour.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—A squall came on during the night, and snapped the
flying jib-boom right in halves: my slumber was broken by
being nearly pitched out of my sea sofa. This being an unfavourable
time of the year for a voyage to England, we have only
two passengers besides ourselves on board,—fortunately they are
most agreeable people. We have now two cabins on the poop,
the larboard stern cabin, and the one next to it, and are therefore
very comfortable.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—We are creeping away to the south; there is a swell,
and we are looking out for the trade wind.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—Rain and calm,—what an annoyance! Oh! for a gale
to carry us with double-reefed topsails over the Line, as we had
in the “Madagascar!” Any thing would be better than this
vile calm. What does it matter if a few spars are snapped, and
a few more sails split asunder, if we do but make way! We
must now be exactly upon the Line: the musquitoes have not
yet quitted my cabin, they plague me greatly. As if in accordance
with my wish, at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a squall came on, and carried us
over the Line.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—A fine favourable breeze,—we flatter ourselves it may
be the trade.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—Squalls and calms.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—A heavy squall, which continued with lightning and
rain in torrents from noon throughout the night: we are quite
dispirited.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—With joy this morning I saw the stunsails were set,
and a fine sun was drying the deck: now I really believe we
have fallen in with the trade.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 3rd.</i>—Never was there so unpleasant a wind as this
south-east trade. It is very strong and constant, but is a succession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
of squalls, both night and day. The ship lies over
very much, and the waves burst upon her in a very disagreeable
fashion; we have made 200 or 225 miles for some days, but
these constant squalls are detestable. There comes the water
rushing into the cuddy at this minute!—we are now about 400
miles from Madagascar.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—I do not mention that Divine service was always
performed on Sundays,—that took place, of course, unless
prevented by a gale. During the night, passed the Island of
Rodorigos, to the north; I did not see the land, distant only
seven miles, my port being shut, on account of having shipped
a sea, which rendered the cabin cold and wet.</p>

<p>Horsburgh remarks, “Hurricanes are liable to happen here
from the beginning of November till the end of March; in
some years there are two, but generally only one, and sometimes
none. They blow with great violence, commencing from southward,
and veering round to east, north-east, and north-west,
where they gradually decrease, after continuing about thirty-six
hours. The fish caught here in deep water with hook and line are
poisonous; whereas, those got by the net in shore are good and
wholesome.” The land is high and uneven, reefs and shoals
encompass it; the harbour is called Maturin’s Bay. The
remarkable peak answers as a guide.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—Passed the Mauritius, and were opposite Bourbon,
about two hundred miles south.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Crossed the Tropic.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Off Madagascar we were caught about noon in the tail
of a whirlwind; fortunately it was only the tail,—the sailors said,
had we fallen into the centre of it, and the vessel had been
unprepared, it would have carried the masts overboard. Rain
fell in torrents; a waterspout was seen for a short time,—and
the wind, hitherto fair, became completely contrary.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—This has proved a most uninteresting voyage as far as
it has gone, nothing to be seen; one solitary albatross appears
now and then, and a few Cape pigeons. The other day I saw a
sperm whale blowing at a distance. There is nothing to look
at but the boundless ocean; even the sunsets and sunrises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
have not been remarkably fine,—no groups of glorious tints
such as I beheld from the “Carnatic” on the other side the
Line.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Cold and dreary. Saw a fin-back whale close astern;
two fine albatross and four Cape pigeons were floating on the
waters; some stormy petrels were cutting about, and dipping
their wings in the waves every moment; and there were also
two black Cape hens. The flight of the Cape pigeon is very
elegant, and the albatross skims along in the most dignified style.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—Lat. S. 33° 56′, Long. E. 29° 6′. A most stormy
sunset: the sun, of a burning gold colour, descended behind a
heavy bank of dark clouds,—its rays were fiercely bright:
shortly afterwards a few spaces of deep fiery red alone remained
visible, surrounded by heavy black clouds; on every side the
grey clouds rose thick and foggy from the horizon, without any
break,—dull and ominous. We were off Cape Hood, Cape of
Good Hope. A strong gale arose, accompanied by sharp
squalls; there was an immense swell upon the sea, the heavy
waves rolled up with great violence, their heads covered with
foam, breaking and roaring as they dashed against the ship, and
the wind blew in furious gusts. The “Essex” was about two
hundred miles from the land when the gale began,—it continued
all night without intermission; the dead-lights were put into
the poop stern windows, and into all the ports. Early in the
morning I saw that my husband had quitted his couch in the
stern cabin, and was sitting in a chair, apparently unable to
cross the cabin, from the violence of the pitching; he had
left his couch because it had become unsafe, the lashings and
the cleets having given way. I assisted him into my cabin,
and he lay down on the sofa; he was quite ill,—so cold and
wretched, from exposure during the night. His kindness and
consideration had prevented his calling me, being unwilling to
awake me, imagining I was asleep, and unconscious of the heavy
gale that was raging around us. My ayha, who usually got up
before daybreak, to smoke her hooqŭ in the galley, made an
effort to quit the cabin; I desired her not to attempt to
move, or she would be thrown down from the pitching and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
rolling of the vessel; but the moment my eye was off her away
she went: she met another ayha in the passage, who said,
“Are you mad, that you want to go and smoke in such a gale
as this?” My ayha, who would sell her soul for half a dozen
whiffs of tobacco, persisted in going; she had not got half way
through the cuddy when she fell, and I heard a violent scream.
The cuddy servants ran to her assistance, and found she had
broken her leg just above the ankle; the bone was through the
flesh, and the wound bled very much. The medical man set her
leg, and with great difficulty we had her removed into the stern
cabin, where we secured her as well as we were able, but not
until some time had passed, as the large heavy toon-wood couch
in the stern cabin had started from its moorings, and, turning
over topsy-turvy, had dashed across the cabin, breaking and
throwing down the table, and carrying away the trunks. Never
was there such confusion as the furniture made in the cabin,
pitching from side to side with the roll of the vessel. At length
the carpenter secured the frisky couch, bound up the wounds of
the table, and relashed them all. By this time the sea was
breaking over the stern windows, and dashing into the
cabin, in spite of the dead-lights, and into the quarter-gallery;
much damage was done on the poop. The medical
man, knowing that leeches sold at the Cape for half-a-crown
apiece, on account of there being none but those
that are imported, on which a heavy duty is paid, took 10,000
of them from Calcutta, secured in large earthen pots (<i>gharās</i>)
full of soft mud, which were all placed on the poop, in a small
boat called “Little Poppet.” The water cistern gave way, and
dashing against “Little Poppet,” upset her, broke all the gharās,
and the sea-water killed the leeches. The cutter that hung
over the quarter was turned up on one side by the force of the
wind, dashed against the side of the “Essex,” was greatly
injured, and rendered utterly useless; three of her oars fell into
the sea, and were borne away, but the sailors secured the boat.</p>

<p>By noon on the 24th (Lat. S. 33° 45′, Long. E. 28°), the current
had carried the vessel one hundred and twenty miles nearer
the land, which was now only eighty miles distant; we were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
driving almost under bare poles, the violence of the wind not
allowing any sail but one small one; another, which they
wished to set, was twice blown to pieces, and could not be
carried. The waves were striking the vessel in the most
frightful manner, roaring in concert with the gale, and jostling
and rolling against the ship as if they were ready to engulf
her. Nevertheless the “Essex” bore bravely on; her captain
put her about, and we ran down the side of the land
for some distance. To sleep—to rest, with so furious a gale
blowing, was impossible; and how the time passed I hardly
remember, for day and night it was the same—pitch, pitch,
roll, roll,—and the same roar: all night long two seamen were
baling out the water from our cabins,—the waves poured
constantly into the cuddy ports on one side, and rolled out
on the other. We sat down to dinner, a plate of food was
brought to each person, and we held on and ate as we could;
every now and then an officer came down for ten minutes, took
his food as hastily as possible, and returned instantly to the
poop,—it was an anxious time.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>About 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the second day, the thunder rolled heavily,
the lightning was very vivid, and hail fell in heavy showers.
The chief officer, having caught up a handful of the large hail,
gave it to me in a plate at the cuddy door, where I amused
myself with eating it, and watching the scene. About this time
the situation of the vessel became critical: the first officer
desired the captain to observe what was coming down on the
weather side; he could not tell what it was, never having seen
any thing of the kind before. The foam of the sea was caught up
by the wind, and whirled round and round in thick masses like
smoke; it blew heavily, and the spray beat with such violence
into the faces of the officers, that at times they could not see.
Not a minute elapsed ere the whirlwind struck the vessel on
her weather side, and the blast was perfectly <i>hot</i>! The captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
called to the men to hold on; they were prepared,—and well
for them they were so: with a tremendous roll the vessel was
pitched over almost on her beam-ends; the thing was so sudden,
and the officers were so blinded by the spray and wind, that they
could not tell whether the whirlwind passed by the stern or the
head of the vessel. Almost as quickly as the wind struck her
on the weather side it was round to the other, and the ship was
taken aback, or brought by the lee.</p>

<p>The mountainous waves were foaming, breaking, and dashing
against her; one great sea broke off the knees of the vessel,
drew out two or three of the long iron bolts, and loosened the
cutwater. The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed, and every
five minutes the hail beat on the decks like the pitching down of
myriads of marbles. At length the horizon cleared, and the
gallant ship, rising over the surge, went on her way rejoicing.
Still the original gale continued with unabated violence, and the
heavy swelling sea was a glorious although an appalling sight.
A lesson of composure might have been read from a trifling
circumstance: during the time that the wind was blowing furiously,
and the waves were mountains crested with foam, on the
lee side of the vessel I saw a stormy petrel, ever such a little wee
bird, floating on the billows, rising and falling with them so quietly,
calmly, and composedly, it appeared wonderful that the wind did
not tear it off the wave and sink it in the waters; but there the
little bird floated and floated, and rose and sank, and was too
wise to unfold her wings for a second, or to attempt to fly.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—We beat out to sea in the face of the north-wester;
it was trying work both for the ship and the men; they succeeded
in getting a proper distance from the land, and we tacked
opposite Algoa Bay. The wind moderated, the sea went down,
merely a long swell continued,—the palpitation of the bosom of
the ocean after the rage into which she had been pleased to
throw herself<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>Unless in mountains like the Himalaya there is nothing in
nature so beautifully grand as a storm at sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span></p>

<p>How much delight may be experienced during a storm! How
animating, how beautiful is the scene! Who can gaze on swiftly
flying clouds, or on rushing waves crested with foam, without
emotions of pleasure? Who can breathe the pure and bracing
air of a stiff gale, and not feel their spirits rise within them?
All those feelings, commonly ridiculed as romantic, which,
shrinking from the eye of the world, hide themselves in the
depths of the heart, are called forth during such a scene. The
memory presents all that is charming in poetry, all that delights
in song, all that best suits with the wild weather: the spirits
rise, and there is perhaps nothing in this world that can be
more fully enjoyed than a storm at sea.</p>

<p>The confidence sailors have in their own skill and resources,
their patience, good spirits, and good humour in days of trial,
impart a portion of their own spirit to those in their society.
I felt more inclined to enjoy the gale than to fear it when on
deck with the officers, but when at night, in the darkness of my
own cabin, with the water dashing in, and the wax-light dimly
burning, I must acknowledge I thought what a wretched sensation
the first dash into one of those roaring waves would give
me, the cold plunge, and the jaw of the shark!</p>

<p>We were in His hands who stilleth the raging of the waves;
I thought of the composure of the little bird, and never allowed
any expression of fear to find its way to my lips, or to appear
on my countenance. The officers were now able to get a little
rest; they must have been exhausted, as they had scarcely
quitted the poop for a moment night or day; their eyes were
red and starting,—how they must have slept when they were
able to turn in! I could have enjoyed the storm, but that
my unfortunate ayha distressed me,—with her broken leg, it
was a fearful thing to be tossed about in such a gale, although
every care and attention was given her. I did not suffer from
<i>mal-de-mer</i>, and was moving about all day and night.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—This was a day of calm, and of repose for the wearied;
also a day for the repair of the damage done by the gale. And
deep I believe was the gratitude felt by all on board for the
protection afforded us during the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span></p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Our course regained, the “Essex” sailed quietly on.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—At sunrise I was summoned in haste to the poop, to
see a remarkable effect in the sky. Just above the spot where
the sun was struggling to appear from behind a bank of reddish
grey clouds, there was thrown across the bright blue sky a long
white cloud, exactly in shape and twist like an Archimedes
screw; I added it, with the sunset of the night before the gale,
to my collection of “Sketches at Sea.” Should I ever live to
be old—or rather, older, how pleasantly these sketches will
recall the memory of the past!</p>

</div>

<p><i>1845, Oct. 29th.</i>—At 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> I was called on deck to look at the
mountains of Africa. The Buffalo, or rather its high peak,
soared black and distinct over the white clouds that rolled
below, covering the whole length of the mountains: here and
there a summit might be distinguished, and the land and hummocks
below the clouds were tolerably clear. The sky was of
the brightest, purest tint of cobalt blue, the white clouds were
crossing it in all directions; the clouds themselves were borne
along by the wind to the right, while their tops were carried
back towards the left, as if they encountered a contrary current
of air aloft. Soon after I had sketched the Buffalo’s most peculiar
black peak, a mist spread over the mountains, the wind changed,
we went further out to sea, and the line of mountains became
too indistinct to afford subject for the pencil. The deep sea
line brought up small shells in considerable quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 1st.</i>—The Quoin lay distant twelve miles from the
“Essex,” E. by N., ½ N., and fifty-seven miles from the Cape—Sandy
Bay lies between the two points. The Gunner’s Quoin
is three or four leagues from Cape Aguilhas, which it resembles.
Cape Aguilhas, or Lagullas, was called by its discoverers, the
Portuguese, Aguilhas, or Needle’s Cape, because the magnetic
needle had no variation there at the time:—the Portuguese
name has been corrupted by the English sailors into Lagullas, or
Lagullus. Hangclip was the next remarkable object. Horsburgh
remarks, “False Bay is formed by the Cape of Good
Hope on the west side and Cape False to the eastward, the
latter being a steep Bluff, resembling a Quoin, which may be
seen at eight leagues’ distance, and appears to lean over to the
west when viewed from the southward, from which, probably, it
was called Hangclip by the Dutch, but sometimes Hottentot’s
Point.”</p>

<p>The outline of the Mountains of Africa was very peculiar
as we approached the <i>Capo-del-Tornados</i>, or Cape of Storms, as
the Cape of Good Hope was called by its first discoverers, the
Portuguese, who afterwards changed the name to that of Capo
del Buon Esperanza. At the distance of sixteen miles we
beheld the Capo-del-Tornados itself, next to it was the Peak;
the high land in False Bay was remarkable, and in the distance,
between these points, you caught a view of the back of Table
Mountain. The scene was very interesting as we sailed along
the range of Mountains, and the fineness of the day allowed
us to see them to advantage. Hout’s Bay was very picturesque;
deep shadows were around the base of the mountains,
and the warm light of the setting sun gilded their
summits.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 2nd.</i>—At sunrise the scene was beautiful; we gazed
on the Lion Mountain opening Green Point,—the Table Mountain
was of a very dark plum colour, in strong contrast with the
glowing brilliancy of the rising sun, and a dark cloud hung upon
the flat surface of the mountain-top. On the opposite side, as we
entered Table Bay, lay Robbin or Penguin Island, with breakers
to the left,—the Whale also, a sunken rock over which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
waves constantly break. The dark Blueberg Mountains to the
right finished the picture.</p>

<p>Anchored in Table Bay during a deep cold fog at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>—took
apartments in an hotel in the Heerengracht,—found the
rooms intensely hot at night, and very disagreeable after the
pure sea air. We drove in the evening to a friend’s house in
the Camp Ground, and gathered a beautiful bouquet from his
garden.</p>

<p>My first thought on arriving in Southern Africa was of the
Mountain, the next of the flowers. A strelizia was brought to me;
it is an indigenous bulb in Africa, and as one flower dies away
another bursts forth. On our return to the ship, I took the
strelizia on board, and watched the bursting forth of the fresh
flowers for some days. A very good sketch of Cape Town may
be taken in the Heerengracht, just below Messrs. Dickson and
Burnie’s; it gives George’s Hotel, now kept by a man of the
name of Duke, the large trees in front, the Dutch Reform
Church, and the Table Mountain beyond. Another good point
is the Market Square, with its pump in the centre, St. George’s
Church, the Town Hall, and the Dutch and Hottentot venders
of fruit and vegetables at their stands in the Green Market, as
they call it.</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson, a stationer in the Heerengracht, has some
admirable water-colour drawings for sale, portraits of the natives
of Africa.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—Drove to Green Point with the captain of the “Essex,”
to see the lighthouse. I climbed up to the roof through a
narrow pigeon-hole, and was well rewarded for my trouble by
the beauty of the view. The beach was covered with shells,
broken into the smallest fragments by the rolling surf. The
view from the rocks, at the end of Green Point, looking over
Camp’s Bay, is very beautiful.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Visited my ayha, whom I had been obliged to send to
the hospital on account of the accident which she met with on
board, and found her quite comfortable. The poor woman was
very glad to see me, and I arranged for her return to Calcutta.
I bought a kaross of eighteen heads, as it is technically called,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
the sole garment worn by the Kafirs, for four pounds; it is very
large and handsome, consisting of skins of the red jackal. With
the exception of the kaross the Kafir is entirely unincumbered
with clothing; these skins are much sought after by officers
on service, which is perhaps the reason they are so expensive
in Cape Town.</p>

<p>The “Essex” was detained at the Cape in consequence of
the repairs that were necessary on account of the damage she
received during the gale; to-day, on her being reported fit
for sea, we repaired on board.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>—At 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the “Essex” quitted Table Bay. It was a
beautiful day—the white clouds from a south-easter that was
blowing were rising over the Table Land,—the sea was a bright
transparent green, with white breakers on every wave, and the
sky was the colour of the purest cobalt blue.</p>

<p>As you pass Robbin or Penguin Island, the Lion Mountain
assumes in a considerable degree the form of a lion reposing,
from which appearance it derives its name:—the rump of the
lion is formed of the mountain on which the telegraph stands.
The scene would have made an excellent sketch, representing
the back of the Table Mountain, with the Devil’s Peak to the
right, the Lion in front; and Robbin Island at the side. The
latter is a low, long, sandy island, with some few houses upon
it, and it looks very desolate. Made a run of two hundred and
nine miles.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Rolling down to St. Helena with a fair breeze in most
agreeable style.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—A most beautiful and brilliant day. Went on deck about
11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to see St. Helena in the distance: sketched the island
from the forecastle, and paid for my footing. The island then
lay N.N.W. distant eight miles: Diana’s Peak, two thousand
six hundred and ninety-two feet high, appeared to be nearly in
the centre: the Needles and Speery were very distinct, as was
also Sandy Bay Point.</p>

<p>St. Helena was discovered by the Portuguese in 1508, on the
festival of St. Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine
the Great. It was taken from the Dutch in 1674 by Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
Munden, and presented to the East India Company by Charles II.;
and it was given up by the Hon. Company to the English
Government for the residence of the Emperor Buonaparte.
Length of the island, ten miles and a half; breadth, six and
three-quarters; circumference at the water’s edge, thirty miles;
twelve hundred miles west of Africa, and eighteen hundred
east of America. Whales are found off the island. It contains
four thousand inhabitants, and thirty thousand acres of arable
and pasture land. The air is salubrious, the valleys are fruitful,
and flocks of wild goats browze on the hills.</p>

<p>The island rises a mass of rocks from the sea; the only two
points for landing are at St. James’s Town, the capital, and at
Sandy Bay. When St. Helena lay five miles S.W. the view
presented was particularly good: you could see George’s
Island, as well as Hercules Island, the flag—staff, Barn Point,
the Sugar-loaf Hill, and the plantation at Longwood. The
pointed summits of the rocks in the distance, whose peaks turn
from each other, are very remarkable.</p>

<p>There is another good view of the island when in front of Barn
Cliff, so called from its fancied resemblance to a great barn.
Sugar-loaf Hill derives its name from its conical shape. I was
told that Sandy Bay was well worth visiting, its scenery being
beautiful,—which I can well imagine, from the wild form of the
rocks around it, when viewed from a distance.</p>

<p>Opening St. Helena Bay, at the base of the Sugar-loaf, are
three batteries, called Buttermilk and Bank’s Upper and Lower
Batteries, at a small distance from each other. We came to
anchor off James’s Town, near the high perpendicular rock of
Ladder Hill, surmounted by its battery and telegraph, above
which, in the distance, High Knoll is to be seen. Diana’s Peak,
the highest point in the island, is two thousand six hundred and
ninety-two feet high; High Peak, or High Knoll, a conical hill,
south-west, is about fifty feet less elevated than the former.
The rock rises eight hundred feet perpendicular from the sea,
with a heavy battery of guns upon it, that command the south-west
entrance to the valley and anchorage. James’s Valley is
also protected by a high wall and strong line of cannon close to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
the sea. The Ladder contains six hundred and seventy steps.
The flag-staff is in the Government gardens, above the battery.
Munden’s Fort and Batteries command the side of James’s
Valley, and Rupert’s Battery is at the bottom of a valley of that
name.</p>

<p>We anchored a little before 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: it was very cold, from
the wind rushing down the valley directly upon the anchorage.
The sunset was fine, in the midst of dark clouds, contrasted
with others of a burning crimson; and to the right the dark
rock of St. Helena rose abruptly from the sea. The more I
gaze on this desolate-looking and rocky island, the deeper
becomes my pity for, and the interest I feel in, the fate of
Buonaparte.</p>

<p>The young officers are in high glee, fishing off the poop; they
have just caught two small silver mackarel. The gun fires at
9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, after which time no boat will quit the island, and no person
is permitted to land. I fear I shall be unable to visit Sandy Bay,
on the other side of the island; an officer of the “Winchelsea”
told me not to miss seeing that bay on any account; he gave us
sixty-two days from the Cape to England, and eleven to St.
Helena; we arrived here in ten days and a quarter. The
captain of the “Essex” came on deck just before we anchored,
he appeared very, very ill,—in my opinion, fearfully so.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—A rainy and cold morning; it cleared about noon,
when I went on shore, and climbed the steps of Ladder Hill for
some distance,—they are almost perpendicular; want of time
prevented my ascending to the summit of the six hundred and
seventy steps. Admired the pretty church just within the
gateway, and visited the market; beef and mutton, ten pence to
one shilling per pound; grapes, just in, at two shillings and
sixpence per pound; the peaches are bad, the loquats the same,
and but few vegetables; beet-root and cabbage good; articles of
every sort very dear.</p>

<p>A good sketch of the town may be taken from the upper end
of the principal street, looking towards the sea. Walked over
the Government gardens, in which is a cenotaph, in memory of
the officers and men who died in the “Waterwitch” off different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
parts of the coast of Africa. In a hut near the beach I saw
a dried flying-fish, sixteen or eighteen inches in length,—offered
the man a shilling for it, which he refused; they are found
now and then in the boats off the rocks, into which they
sometimes happen to fly or fall; the largest found at St. Helena
are twenty-four inches in length, and are very delicate food.</p>

<p>Went down to the foot of the cliff under Ladder Hill, where
the breakers were dashing over a fine reef of rocks that run
out into the sea in most picturesque style; an old anchor was
cast on one of them, and beyond it lay a cannon,—the
effect of the anchor cast away on the rocks was good. Several
boys were fishing there; they brought me some <i>blue</i> fish, which
are very beautiful, of a brilliant deep purplish blue colour,
interspersed with crimson streaks,—they are considered great
delicacies. They showed me some beautiful fish, spotted with
red,—these are also very good for food. I picked up some
black sea eggs, young crabs, and limpets; the latter are eaten
by the French. Returned on board, much against my will,—I
could have spent the day very happily on the rocks which jut
out below the great cliff on which the Ladder is built. At
5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the “Essex” fired a gun; the anchor was raised, which
appeared to be hard work in such deep water, and we once
more set sail for old England.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—The captain dangerously ill.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—Since we quitted St. Helena we have made excellent
runs daily in a direct line for Ascension, and the vessel has been
so steady we have scarcely felt any motion.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>—Passed Ascension about 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: the island has the
appearance of a cluster of mountains of a conical form. One
small eminence, Cross Hill, is so called from the cross that
surmounts it. Green Mountain is the highest point in the
island,—viewed from some points it has a double peak.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>—Divine service. Crossed the line with a seven and
a half knot breeze. One of the officers reminded me that he
was in the “Madagascar” with me when we re-crossed the line
under reefed topsails.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 1st.</i>—A fine favourable breeze. The captain is very ill;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
I fear he is sinking into his grave. He was in delicate
health before the gale, and the exertion he underwent at that
time was too much for him; there is but faint hope of his
recovery.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—Picked up the north-east trade. The captain’s illness
increased at night, and about ten o’clock he expired.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—At 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the funeral took place: the corpse having
been sewed up in canvas was placed on the main hatch, with
the colours spread over it: when the ceremony of the burial of
the dead commenced, the body was placed with the feet to the
open gangway, on a plank, in a sloping position; the colours
had been thrown over it, but you could trace the form of the
corpse through them. When the words, “We commit this
body to the deep,” were pronounced, the men who stood by the
corpse launched it forwards into the sea, and it sank immediately.
The chief officer read the service,—he was deeply
affected; the captain had been his friend, and he had attended
him during his illness with the greatest solicitude; he read the
service in a broken and trembling voice,—the tears rolling down
his cheeks,—he could scarcely master his agony. It is a fearful
sight to witness such a struggle in a firm and powerful man.
He was performing the request of his departed friend: a few
days before, when he informed the captain of his danger; the
latter looked surprised, and said, “Well, B⸺, my good fellow,
I have but one request to make,—give me a sailor’s grave.”
The next day he arranged his worldly affairs, and was employed
in devotion. Mr. B⸺ bore up during the life of his friend,
but to part with him,—to commit his body to the deep,—to
read the service over him,—must have been a bitter trial. The
crew were all present, and tears ran down many a hardy
sunburnt face; the captain was greatly beloved both by the
officers and men. The passengers appeared in mourning at the
funeral. The day was a most lovely one,—the bright waves
flew by the ship as the trade wind bore her onwards, and the
breeze tempered the heat of the sun. I thought of the festering
and air-poisoning churchyards of London, and felt, as far as I
am concerned, how much I should prefer a sailor’s grave,—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
bright wave dashing o’er me, and the pure air above, to the
heavy sod and the crowded churchyard.</p>

  <p class="right">Sketched on the Spot by ‎‏فاني پارکس‏‎</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>7th.</i>—And now once more for England. Saw a schule of
whales—the fin-back; one of them was near the ship, blowing
up the water, about six feet high; the large Greenland whale
spouts much higher.</p>

<p>A Chinese calculation was shown us in the evening, which is
worthy the trouble of discovering: take a pack of cards,—the
ace counts as one, knave, queen, king, as ten each; look at the
top card (suppose it be an ace), lay it with its face upon the
table, and add to it as many cards as will make the number
twelve,—that is, eleven cards on the back of the ace; then take
the next card from the pack (suppose it be a knave), place it face
downwards, count it as ten, and add to the back of it two cards,
which will make it twelve; then take the next card (suppose
it a four), place it in the same manner, and add eight cards to
it, which will make it twelve, counting each card as one. In
this manner dispose of the whole pack; there may be some
cards over, lay them aside. The conjurer will then see the
number of the packs, and the number of cards remaining over,
and will be able by calculation to tell the amount of the pips on
the bottom cards, which he has not seen, that are with their
faces downwards on the table. This calculation is ingenious, and
may be discovered by algebra.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—The nine-knot breeze continues, which we have had
for the last two days; and the “SX” pitches so much I can
scarcely write.</p>

<h3>WATERSPOUTS.</h3>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Lat. N. 32° 15′, long. W. 27° 55′. At noon heavy
clouds were around us, and a waterspout appeared astern; it
was at a considerable distance. The sea whirled, and rose up to
meet it to a great height; it continued for about twenty
minutes, and was too far astern to do us any injury. The trade
was strong, and we were going nine knots an hour. At the
same time another waterspout appeared about three miles off, on
the starboard,—it was coming towards the ship from the south-east;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
it was of considerable size, and whirled and foamed very
distinctly; fortunately it passed astern until it gained the point
where the first waterspout had been seen, of which a portion
above was still visible. Captain B⸺ fired a cannon at it,
which appeared to have little or no effect: very heavy clouds
were all around the vessel, but as soon as the spouts disappeared
in the south-west, the sun came out brilliant as usual. I sketched
the second spout just as it came astern, and a remnant of the
upper part of the former waterspout was in the distance.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Passed St. Michael’s to the westward, of which we had
a distant view.</p>

<h3>PICO.</h3>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—At 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we had a good view of the Island of Pico,
with its most remarkable peak above the clouds, and an hour
afterwards we had a still clearer glimpse of its bell-shaped
summit, which is eleven thousand feet above the sea. The
smoke of fires burning on the mountain was visible.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we were off Fayal, the white buildings of the
town appeared to rise from the dark waters, and the effect was
most singular. The lookouts are on the cliff. The distant
blue land, of which we caught a sight behind the town, is
St. George’s Island. Passing along Fayal, the Convent, which
is situated nearly in the centre of the island, was distinctly
visible; there appeared to be some painting on the outside
walls. The vineyards looked green and luxuriant.</p>

<p>At the end of the Island of Fayal is a curious and insulated
rock; the turbulent sea has worn a deep cavern in this rock,
through which the light is visible. Above, on the main land,
are steep perpendicular cliffs; some are of the colour of burnt
<i>terra di sienna</i>, others of a bright deep reddish brown: the
shadows were heavy, and a brilliant light was caught upon the
cliffs—a tremendous swell from the north-east was dashing
in breakers half-way up the lofty cliff. I think I never saw
breakers rise so high before—on the horizon was a fog-bank—the
cavern bearing east four or five miles. The day was beautiful
and most favourable: I was delighted with this passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
view of the Western Isles, very much gratified; the air was
sharp and cold, the sunshine brilliant; and I believe every one
on board enjoyed the scene.</p>

</figure>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—The Western Isles invisible.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>—The day was cold and raw, nearly a calm. At night
the sailors sent off a tar-barrel with a fire in it, which went
blazing along; a nautical method of celebrating Christmas Eve.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—A cold raw day, with rain and fog. Divine service
was performed in the cuddy. The sea almost a calm.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—With a fine wind we are going nine knots off the
Lizard, and looking forward to the termination of our voyage;
but I cannot quit the vessel without expressing how much we
have been satisfied with all the arrangements on board, which
reflect great credit on the owners of the ship; and how much
the attention of the commanding officer to our wishes and
accommodation has removed the annoyances that old Indians
necessarily must experience during a sea voyage: the vessel is
well manned, her provisions are excellent and abundant, every
attention is shown to the passengers, and the “Essex” is a
good ship.</p>

<p><i>1846, Jan. 1st.</i>—At 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, off Portland Race, it was bitterly
cold, and I began to speculate if it were possible to exist in
England.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>—Off Folkstone, at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>—I quitted the “Essex” in a
Deal boat, over which the waves danced, and the wind was
bitterly cold; landed at Folkstone in about four hours, half
starved, cold, and hungry, and took refuge at the Pavilion Hotel,
where a good dinner and the luxuries of native oysters and
fresh butter made us forget all the ills that flesh is heir to.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—Started per train at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and found ourselves once
more in London.</p>

<p>And now the pilgrim resigns her staff and plucks the scallop-shell
from her hat,—her wanderings are ended—she has quitted
the East, perhaps for ever:—surrounded in the quiet home of her
native land by the curiosities, the monsters, and the idols that
accompanied her from India, she looks around and dreams of
the days that are gone.</p>

<p>The resources she finds in her recollections, the pleasure she

<p class="noindent">And to those kind friends, at whose request she has published the
history of her wanderings, she returns her warmest thanks for
the pleasure the occupation has afforded her. She entreats
them to read the pilgrimage with the eye of indulgence, while
she remembers at the same time that,</p>

<h3 class="appendix" id="appendix1">No. I.—<i>Copy of the inscription in the church of Tanworth, Warwickshire.</i>—<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74042/pg74042-images.html#Page_58">Vol.
i. p. 58.</a></h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center smaller">“Heu Pietas! heu prisca Fides!”</p>

<p>“Sacred to the memory of Andrew Lord Archer, Baron of Umberslade,
who died April 25th, 1778, ætatis forty-one, and lies interred in
the family vault beneath. He was the last male descendant of an
ancient and honourable family that came over with William the Conqueror,
and settled in the county of Warwick in the reign of King
Henry the Second, from whom his ancestors obtained grants of land in
the said county. He married Sarah, the daughter of James West,
Esquire, of Alscot, by whom he has left four daughters.</p>

<p>“To perpetuate his fair fame this monument is erected by her who
knew and loved his virtues.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the Peerage of England by Arthur Collins, Esq., vol. vii. p. 359,
4th edition, is the following account:—</p>

<p>“This family, one of the most ancient in Warwickshire, came out of
Normandy, where some of the name, bearing the same arms, are yet
existing. In Stow’s Annals, printed in 1615, is a list taken from a
table anciently in Battle Abbey, of those who came into England with
William Duke of Normandy, in which the name of Archer is inserted;
also in an ancient roll, cited by Stow, of the names of the chief noblemen,
&amp;c. who, in 1066, accompanied William the Conqueror into
England, collected by Thomas Scriven, Esq., the name of Archer
occurs.”</p>

<p>Edward Gwynn, Esq., a learned antiquary in the reign of King
James the First, demonstrates very clearly, that Fulbert l’Archer, with
his son Robert, came into England with William the Conqueror; and
that the said Fulbert was in England, and of eminent degree, is
apparent, by his being witness to several concessions of Geffery de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
Clinton, a Norman, who was treasurer and lord chamberlain to King
Henry the First, and founder of the monastery of Kenilworth in
Warwickshire.</p>

<p>Mr. Gwynn in his dissertation further recites, that Robert l’Archer
also accompanied his father Fulbert into England with William the
Conqueror; and was in such estimation for his learning, that the said
king appointed him to instruct his son, King Henry the First (then
prince), who, to his tutor’s credit, was (as Gemmeticencis saith) “Justitiæ
ac pacis sectator, religionis amator, iniquorum, et furum ferventissimus
punitor, inimicorum suorum, non solum excellentium Principum,
et Comitum, verum et nominatissimorum Regum fælicissimus Triumphator.”
How well he deserved the respect and esteem of the said
prince, and how well he was rewarded by him, when he came to be king,
the following grant fully manifests: “<i>Henricus, Dei Gratia, &amp;c. Sciatis Nos
dedisse et concessisse, Roberto l’Archer, magistro meo, et hæred. suis, &amp;c.
Manor de Aldermanson, Fynchampsted, Coletrope, Speresholt, Chewlewe,
&amp;c. in com. Berks.</i>” Which manors and lands thereunto belonging King
Henry II. confirmed to William l’Archer, his son. King Henry I.’s
estimation of the said Robert l’Archer, and the account he made of his
service, may be conceived in vouchsafing to call him his master, also by
his liberal donations to him.</p>

<h3 class="appendix" id="appendix2">No. II.—<i>To freeze ice cream in an English freezing pail, enough for a
large party.</i></h3>

<p>The freezing pail should always be of pewter,—those from England
are the best. The natives make them of a composition that answers
well, but it is necessary to be careful in this respect, lest, having a portion
of lead in them, the ice should be rendered poisonous from the
effect of the lime-juice. The lid of the freezing pail ought to be made
with a catch to prevent its coming off when the pail is turned round by
the hand in the bucket of ice. The freezing pail should be of pewter,
because it prevents the contents of the vessel from congealing too
quickly, and there is time to mix them thoroughly; for on this, in a
great measure, depends the excellence of the ice: if it be made of tin, the
congelation is too rapid, and the materials have not time enough to
allow of their being well mixed.</p>

<p>When an article is iced, it does not lose its sweetness; no additional
sugar or syrup is requisite; the loss of sweetness arises from the materials
not being properly mixed or worked with a bamboo or spaddle
when in the freezing pail. The natives do not open the freezing pail
and stir the mixture with a spaddle; on the contrary, they fasten the lid
down securely by putting paste all round the edges: consequently, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span>
cream ice is as hard as real ice itself. Properly stirred it resembles
hard snow, after the fashion of the Parisian ice cream.</p>

<h3 class="appendix" id="appendix3">No. III.—<i>Strawberry or raspberry ice cream.</i></h3>

<p>Cream three-fourths, fresh milk one-fourth, five large table-spoonfuls
of jam; two ditto of fresh lime-juice, one ditto of colouring
mixture. If you find it not sweet enough, add a little syrup or melted
sugar, not pounded sugar. Beat the cream, milk, and jam through a
hair sieve, and mix them well; add the lime-juice and the colouring
mixture; stir it well, and put it into the freezing pail. The pail holds
about two quarts. Take a deep ice basket, lay a bazār blanket inside,
place within it a clean dry bucket, put the freezing pot into the bucket.</p>

<p>Half <i>ser nowshādar</i> (sal ammoniac), one <i>ser</i> common salt, one <i>ser</i>
saltpetre, with eight or ten <i>ser</i> of ice. The saltpetre and salt should be
previously roughly pounded. Mix the whole of this together quickly in
a blanket; put the mixture into the bucket until it is nearly up to the
top and all round the freezing pail; turn the freezing pail round and
round in the mixture, holding it by the handle for ten minutes, then
leave it for a quarter of an hour, cover the top with ice; cover up all
inside with the blanket, and put on the cover of the ice basket; do not
let it stand near a <i>tattī</i>. In the course of ten minutes or a quarter of
an hour, open the freezing pail, stir the cream round with a long wooden
spoon, or a bit of bamboo, cut flat, or a spaddle. You will find it has
congealed on the sides, but not in the centre; remove the spoon, put on
the lid, turn the pail round for a short time, and cover it up again; this
must be repeated until the cream is properly frozen, when it is fit for
use. Should the cream not have frozen properly, the freezing mixture,
if any remain over, or more ice, may be put into the bucket. In about
an hour, or a little more, the cream ice will be ready. It should
not be made until just before it is required for use.</p>

<p>Cream ices may be made with strawberry, raspberry, or any other

more reasonable than that sent from England.</p>

<h3 class="appendix" id="appendix5">No. V.—<i>To freeze two quarts of strawberry cream in a native kulfī.</i></h3>

<p>The khānsāmāns make ice in a pewter vessel, called a <i>kulfī</i>; it contains
a quart, and ought to have a removable lid. The bottom of the
<i>kulfī</i> should be a fixture. For two <i>kulfīs</i> of this size take eight <i>chhattaks</i>
of saltpetre, eight ditto salt, four ditto <i>nowshādar</i> (sal ammoniac); mix
them together, having first pounded them separately. Mix these ingredients<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span>
with ice sufficient to fill an earthenware pan, that with a broad mouth
will hold two <i>kulfīs</i> standing erect in it. Having put your <i>kulfīs</i> in the
jar, surround them with ice nearly to the rim; put the remainder
of the ice into a napkin, and lay it over the top of the <i>kulfīs</i>; then
cover over the whole with an earthenware cover. Open the <i>kulfīs</i> in a
quarter of an hour, and stir the cream with a flat bamboo, which is a
better thing than a spoon for the purpose; cover them up; open again
in another quarter of an hour, stir, and leave them for four hours; no
fresh ice need be added.</p>

<p>For one <i>kulfī</i> half the quantity of the mixture, and a smaller earthenware

<p>The cheapness and abundance of emery in Europe, and its being
nearly equal to corundum in hardness, have, perhaps, prevented the
Indian corundum from being brought home; but there appears every
probability that the substance which has been lately sold at a high price
in small quantities, under the name of <i>diamond powder</i>, said to be from
the <i>diamond</i> mines of India, and applied to the purpose of sharpening
razors and other cutlery, is nothing else than corundum reduced to a
fine powder. The common <i>karand patthar</i> of India, the corundum or
adamantine spar, so named from its hardness, will cut and polish all
stones except the diamond. By the natives it is used with oil for removing
rust from steel, after which the steel is re-polished with buffalo horn and
a semicircular steel instrument.</p>

wash them with pure water, and with a <i>soft</i> toothbrush gently brush off
any part of the green that may still adhere to the fibres. Leave them
in clean water for some days, and brush them daily, very gently, separately,

<p>First make your lampblack in this manner: Put a cotton wick into an
earthen saucer, such as are put under flower-pots, put common oil
into the saucer, light the wick, and place over it another earthen saucer, so
that the flame may blacken it; in a few hours a quantity of lampblack
will collect on the upper saucer, which is of the very best sort. Mix a
little of this lampblack with fine linseed oil, dip your pen into it, and
trace on the <i>talk</i> with it, having first put your <i>talk</i> over the drawing you
wish to copy. When you take off the <i>talk</i>, if you put white paper
beneath it, you will see if any part require to be darkened: touch the
distances lightly, and the foregrounds strongly. Be careful not to put
too much oil with the lampblack, or it will run, and spoil the drawing.
Having finished your tracing, damp a piece of China paper with a
sponge, put it on the <i>talk</i> while it is <i>very damp</i>, take care not to stir it,
put another piece of paper over it, and pass your hand steadily over all,
when the impression will come off good and clear. Patterns for work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>

<p>Make your lampblack as above directed. Make two balls, about the size
of your fist, with wool and wash-leather; put a bit of stick into the centre
of each, to serve as a handle, and tie the leather tight upon it; flatten it
to the shape of a printer’s ball; the top of a white leather long glove
will do, or chamois leather. With a spatula mix some lampblack with
a little linseed oil, put it on the balls, rub both balls together until it is
all smooth and even, put a freshly-gathered leaf between the balls, pat
the leaf on both sides, put it between two sheets of paper, rub your
finger carefully over the leaf; take up the paper, and you will have two
beautiful impressions. Stalks and flowers may be done in the same
way, and corrected with a pen and some of the oil and lampblack. The
Chinese books sold in the <i>burā bazār</i>, Calcutta, are excellent for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The turban should be of fine India muslin, twenty-one yards in
length, by fourteen inches and a half in breadth. Take one end, put it
over your head, allowing a quarter of a yard to hang down your back;
twist the muslin in front of your forehead, so that it may form a sort of
skull cap on the top of your head; after which, begin to bind
the turban round your head, and go on, until, in fanciful bands, you
have used up the whole. Take the little end hanging down your back,
turn it up, and stick it under one of the folds. This turban, when
properly put on, is not at all large. Should it not set out enough, you
must first bind a smaller and coarser turban around your head, and put
the fine one over it. A Benares gold turban, or a Bengal muslin,
spotted in gold, should be worn over a turban of this sort; they are too
flimsy to set properly of their own accord. A long fine Cashmere shawl
forms into a beautiful turban.</p>

<p><i>Another method.</i>—Turbans are more generally put on in this manner
than in the preceding: Take the middle of the cloth, put it over the
front of the head, and pass the two ends behind. Take one end, and
pass it round and round your head until it is all used up; after which
take the other end, and pass it round in some different fashion; when
you have used it all up it ought to set properly.</p>

<p>Almost all turbans are thus put on, with the exception of stiff turbans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span>
which are made over a bamboo frame; they are formal, and want the
graceful and fanciful ease of a turban formed of a strip of muslin hastily
thrown around the head.</p>

<p>Some are formed on a light wicker frame; others, made up by
regular turban makers in the bazār, are formed on blocks, and the
muslin is plaited and put on in a very exact and regular style.
Some turbans appear as if formed of coloured rope, so tightly do they
twist the muslin into a cord ere it is wound round the head.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">AN EXTRACT FROM “THE TIMES,” NOV. 23, 1847.</p>

<p>“Our readers are aware that the Hindoos are not the aboriginal
inhabitants of India. Arriving from the north-west, they first occupied
that moiety of the peninsula to the north of the Nerbudda called emphatically
Hindostan, and subsequently crossed that river into the
Deccan, or ‘south’ portion of the country, where they dispossessed the
natives as before. There are reasons for concluding that this expulsion
of the early inhabitants by the Brahminical Hindoos was characterized
by great ferocity on the part of the invaders. The inferior tribes, however,
were by no means exterminated. Under the various denominations
of Bheels, Coles, Gonds, Khonds, &amp;c., they still exist in the peninsula,
to the number, it is computed, of at the least two or three millions.
Whether they are branches of the same family or not appears hardly
ascertained, but they all possess features in common, and are altogether
distinct, not only from the Hindoo, but also from the Thibetan varieties
of native tribes near the Himalayan range. They are small, dark, and
active, with a peculiarly quick and restless eye, highly barbarous, and
owning only a few importations of Hindoo superstitions or civilization.
They have little clothing, few arms but bows and arrows, and no
ordinary food beyond berries or game. They have no repugnance to
killing or eating oxen, and bury their dead instead of burning them.
Their religious rites involve much greater barbarism than the Brahminical
precepts; indeed, it is alleged by the advocates of Hindoo
excellence that the most objectionable practices attributed to the disciples
of Brahma have either been imported from these tribes at a late period,
or erroneously related by writers who confused the identity of the
nations. This is said to have been particularly the case with human
sacrifices, which had no place in the original code of the Vedas, while
they were so inveterately established among these older tribes, that the
disturbances of the present day have actually originated in the defence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span>
of the rite. The main retreat of these people from the persecution of
the invaders was in the hills, which, under the names of the Vindhya
and Santpoora ranges, rise on each bank of the Nerbudda, and form the
barrier between the Deccan and Hindostan. At the eastern extremity
these hills expand into a lofty mountain rampart on the confines of
Orissa and Berar, forming, with the contiguous districts, the most barbarous
and unreclaimed portion of the whole peninsula. Much of it,
in fact, is unexplored to this day, as may be seen by a glance, in any
map, along the western frontier of Orissa. Such are the actors, and
such the scene of the present disturbances. A few words more will
explain their origin and character.</p>

<p>“The eastern coast of India between the Delta of the Ganges and
the mouths of the Kistna came into our possession by successive instalments.
In 1765 the sagacity of Lord Clive demanded, and his power
obtained, the cession of that maritime province known by the name of
the Northern Circars, previously attached to the Government of the
Deccan, but readily and cheaply yielded by the emperor to the request
of the victorious general. This carried the Madras presidency along
the coast nearly up to the confines of Bengal; the sole interruptions to
a continuity of English territory being the Southern Sircar of Guntoor
at the lower end, still depending on the Deccan, and the province of
Cuttack at the upper, claimed by the Mahratta Prince of Berar. The
former, after considerable turmoil on both sides, was surrendered by
Nizam Ali in 1788, and the latter by Bhonslay at the end of the
first great Mahratta war of 1803. The contiguous districts, forming
part of the ceded territories, were restored by the policy of Sir G. Barlow,
and did not finally return to us till the conclusion of the war of 1818,
when the inveterate hostility of Apa Saheb was punished by the demand
of these peculiar territories on the Nerbudda, solely valuable as opening
a communication between Bengal and Bombay. We found the eastern
country in the hands of petty Rajahs of ancient standing, and some
consideration amongst their subjects, though they were not of the aboriginal
race, but individual families (apparently Rajpoots) of the invading
nation who had contrived to establish themselves in hereditary power
amongst the savages. As long as we were content to allow these people
their ancient licence, to accept a small uncertain subsidy by way of rent,
and leave them to their own privileges and habits, things went well
enough; but as soon as the more scrupulous civilization of later times
introduced or attempted reforms, disturbances at once ensued. A settlement
of a fixed, though not extortionate, rent was imposed upon the
Rajahs, and when this fell seriously in arrear they were dispossessed.
Police were introduced in some of the villages, and civil courts established.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span>
The consequences were speedily visible. In 1816 the Goomsoor
people rose in arms to demand an ejected Rajah; and though
a force of 3000 men in the country repressed these outbreaks, yet
they could not be prevented from aiding a similar insurrection in
Cuttack immediately afterwards, nor was peace entirely restored for
three long years, and then only after some conciliatory abolitions of
the obnoxious institutions.</p>

<p>“In the present case the rebellion (in Goomsoor) is based on our
interference with their Meriah sacrifices, in observance of which rite
they store, fatten, butcher, and dissect some hundreds of children
annually, distributing the fragments, as a propitiatory offer to the local
Ceres, over the surface of their fields, and the old cry for their indulgent
Rajahs is again raised. The Khonds—the precise tribe who gave us so
much trouble in 1816—are again the chief insurgents, though common
cause is eagerly made by all their neighbours. Their method of fighting
is to lurk in their tangled thickets and shoot their arrows from the
ambuscade. Recently, too, they exchanged a herd of bullocks which
they captured, for some fire-arms, and they are said now to possess
some 700 or 800 matchlocks. This, of course, does not make them less
noxious, but their offensive warfare forms but a small part of the dangers
of the campaign. The tracts about which they roam are, beyond all
comparison, the most pestilential in India. The air of Shikarpoor is
bracing and salubrious compared with the atmosphere of these territories.
The malaria of their jungles is almost certain death, and a bivouac
in the bush will cause far more havoc in an invading force than a
battery of cannon. In addition to this, beasts of prey swarm in every
cave and forest, numerous and ravenous enough to give a clean account
of all stragglers. The ordinary briefness of an Indian campaign is here
so far circumscribed, that there are very few weeks in the year when an
inroad would even be attempted, and at this moment not 200 men of
the regiment employed there are fit for duty.</p>

<p>“The Khonds are in nowise disaffected to us, nationally. On the
contrary, when Sir G. Barlow surrendered their country again to Berao,
against our compact and their entreaties, he was forced in decency to
offer a home in Cuttack to those who chose still to live under English
rule, and the struggle between the latter wish and the reluctance to quit
their birthplaces produced some very tragical scenes. Towards the
west, too, the Bheels are enrolled in local corps in the Company’s
service, and conduct themselves with very great credit. The only rebellion
is that of a hardy, barbarous, and inaccessible race, against masters
whose supremacy they gladly own, but whose civilization they are
averse to borrowing.”</p>

<p>Birds to the size of a pigeon may be preserved from putrefaction
by an easy process, and by a method which will effectually guard
them against the attacks of insects. Carefully remove the abdominal
viscera at the vent, by means of a wire bent to a hook at one end; then
introduce a small piece of the antiseptic paste, and afterwards as much
clipped cotton or tow as may be thought sufficient, with some of the
paste mixed with it; remove the eyes and fill the orbits with cotton
imbued with the paste; draw out the tongue, which remove, and pass
a wire from the mouth into the cavity of the cranium, merely to give
the antiseptic access to the brain; bind a piece of thread round the
rostrum, another piece round the body and wings; then hang it up by
the legs, and pour in at the vent from half an ounce to two ounces,
according to the size of the bird, of alcohol; let it be hung in an airy
situation, and it will soon dry without any unpleasant smell.</p>

<h3 class="appendix" id="appendix26">No. XXVI.—<i>Antiseptic paste.</i></h3>

<p>Antiseptic paste is made by mixing eight parts of finely-powdered

powdered camphor three ounces; fine lime, in powder, three ounces;
salt of tartar, six ounces; keep it corked in a jar. Melt the
soap, and gradually mix the other ingredients. When required to be
used, take a little out, mix it with water until it is of the consistence
of thick cream; spread on the skin thinly with a brush. By using too
much you render the skin brittle—put a little cotton wool on the part
when done. Useful for the skins of quadrupeds, large birds, and also for
insects, moths, and butterflies.</p>

<p>Mix one <i>ser</i> of large <i>hurs</i> (<i>hura</i>, ink-nut, myrobalan chebulic) with half
a <i>pāisa</i> weight of <i>ghī</i>, fry them until they are quite black and split, take
them out and cover them over with red-hot charcoal ashes at night.
Wipe them clean, and separate the pulp, which reduce to a subtile
powder in an iron mortar; add to every <i>tolā</i> of the above powder three-fourths
of a <i>masha</i> of <i>tūtiyā tā’ūsi</i>, and half a <i>masha</i> of salt.</p>

<p>When you wish to dye your hair, take some of the powder, mix it
with water so as to form an unctuous paste, and grind it very fine in an
<i>iron</i> mortar; apply it to the hair, and tie it up with fresh-gathered
castor oil leaves. Should the hair not be dyed as required, wet the hair
with water, as also the leaves, and tie it up again, as the dye will not
have the desired effect if the hair be not kept moist with it. The
mortar must be of iron, or the mixture will be spoiled.</p>

<p>“The tomb of Imām Mirmaun is a lofty building of red granite,
close to the Kutb Minar. This saint is said to have lived in the reign
of Altumush.”</p>

<p>“The mausoleum of the monarch Altumush is about four hundred
yards south-west of the Kutb Minar. The walls are of granite, the
tomb of plain marble, and there is no dome to the building.”</p>

<p>“Near this is an octagonal building, the tomb of Adam Khan, a
Pathan nobleman, who was high in the confidence of Altumush.”</p>

<p>“The tomb of the saint Kutb-u-Dīn is of white marble, and a fine
mosque of red granite adjoins it. The court of the mosque contains the
tombs of the Emperor Bahadur Shah, who died in 1707, and the Emperor
Alum Shah, deceased 1807; and also that of the last Emperor, Akbar
Shah.”</p>

<p>“Connected with these tombs is a small marble mosque, built by
Aurangzēb, the father of Bahadur Shah. The marble enclosure where
the body of saint Kutb reposes was built by Ferocksher, who was
assassinated by the Syuds of Burrah, in 1713. Zabtah Khan, father of
the infamous Gholam Khadir Ali Bahadur, and a number of other
nobles, with many of the royal family, are interred in the area. It is
reported that three hundred thousand martyrs to the Muhammadan
faith are buried in this vicinity; in the number must be included those
who fell in the eight battles fought with Rājā Pittourah, by Kutb-u-Dīn
Abeck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span></p>

<p>“Tuglukabad was built by the Patan Emperor, Yeas-u-Dīn Tugluk
Shah, who died in 1324. The place is a mass of ruins; the palace was
large and extensive; four massive bastions still remain. On a detached
rock, connected with the palace by a causeway, is the tomb of Tugluk
Shah; the rock is enclosed by a rampart of stone, with circular bastions.
To the east of Tuglukabad few ruins are to be seen, but thence to
beyond the Shalimar gardens, to the west, a distance of about twenty-five
miles, the whole face of the country is one sheet of ruined palaces,
gardens, streets, and tombs.”</p>

<p>“The Kutb Minar is about twelve miles south-east of Delhi, and
half-way is the mausoleum of Munsoor Alī Khan Sufdar Jung, Wuzeer
of the Emperor Ahmad Shah, who died 1753. It is a fine edifice
raised on a terrace.”</p>

<p>“The tomb that contains the body of Sufdar Jung is on the ground-floor;
the marble cenotaph is in the apartment above it. To the east
the entrance is through a noble gateway, to the north of which is
the mosque.</p>

<p>“About two hundred yards from this is the mausoleum of the great
Byram Khan, <i>khān-khānān</i> and guardian to Mahomed Akbar. The
colours of the enamel of the inside of the dome over Secunder Shah,
one of the Pathan dynasty, deceased 1275, are as fresh as ever. This
mausoleum is a very fine one; it lies about half a mile north-west of
Sufdar Jung’s.”</p>

<p>“The tomb of the saint Nizam-u-Dīn, who lived in the reign of
Secunder Shah, lies about half a mile east-south-east of Humaioon’s;
and adjoining is the tomb of the Princess Jahānārā, as well as that of
the Emperor Mahomed Shah, deceased 1748. Here also is the tomb
of the famous poet Chusero, who flourished 1280; it is of red granite,
small and plain. A Persian nobleman, Tuckee Khan, here lies interred;
as also his son, Azim Khan. They attended Humaioon on his return
from Persia. Azim Khan’s tomb in the centre of the building is surrounded
by others of his family. From the tomb of Nizam-u-Deen two
roads lead to modern Delhi, the upper through the Pathan city, a heap
of ruins; and the lower by the river-side, and Secunder Shah’s Fort,
(1297,) which contains a superb mosque. West, are the ruins of the
palace of Feroze Shah (1351).”</p>

<p>“The old <i>lall Darwaza</i>, or red gate of the Pathan city, is about four
hundred yards east of the Delhi Gate of the modern city. It is lofty,
and built of red granite.</p>

<p>“The palaces and mosques are numerous. The palace of Sultan
Dara Sheko, eldest son of Shahjahan, is now the Magazine. The palace
of the minister of the late Shah Alum is now the Residency. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
palace of Ali Murdan Khan is near the Cashmere Gate; that of Sadut
Khan is at the Cabul Gate; and in the Adjmeer street are the ruins of
the palace of the Wuzeer of Mahomed Shah.</p>

<p>“Connected with the palace at Delhi by a stone bridge is the Fort of
Selīm Garb, built on a rock in the river: it was formerly used as a
prison for the Empress.</p>

<p>“Outside the Cashmere Gate, on the bank of the river, is the Koodsiya
Bagh, built by Shahjahan; it is now in ruins. From this garden,
and encircling the city, is Mogul Parrah, a most extensive town, now a
mass of ruins. Outside the Ajmeer Gate is the tomb of Ghazi-o-dīn,
and appertaining to it are the ruins of a college. On the opposite side
of the road are the tombs of Kummeer-u-Dīn, his father and his daughter,
which are worthy of a visit.</p>

<p>“About three miles from the city is the royal garden, named Toal ka
Tourah. Of the famous garden of Shalimar, about ten miles from the
city, on the road leading to Kurnaul, there are no remains.</p>

<p>“Near the tomb of Zeenut-al Nissa is that of Malaka Zemanī, one of
the widows of the Emperor Mahomed Shah. She was implicated in
the rebellion of Ghoolam Khadir. A small mosque of red granite is
near the tomb.</p>

<p>“Leading out of a postern south of the Lahore Gate, is a mosque
called the Kuddum Roosool, or foot of the Prophet, in memory of
the Arabian prophet, ‘<i>Nubbee Kurreem</i>,’ Mahummud himself,—no other
person has this appellation of ‘the Prophet of Beneficence.’” A
number of tombs of men of rank are in the area, and on the outside:
this is deemed a holy spot, and as sacred as Nizam-u-Dīn’s, or Kutb-u-Dīn’s.</p>

<p>“The Subzy Mundee, or vegetable market, is about three miles from
the city on the road to Kurnaul, and beyond this, on both sides of the
road, are the ruins of houses and gardens, reaching far beyond Shalimar:
a number also lay on the west of Kudsīya Bagh, beyond the range
of hills that rise about four miles west of the city, take a semicircular
sweep, and extend in the shape of a semicircle to Tuglukabad east, forming
an amphitheatre, the whole extent of which is covered with ruins.”</p>

<p>Mr. Greville, zoological artist, 85, New Bond Street, charges for specimens
as follows:—A cock moonal, or blue pheasant, 5<i>l.</i>; a hen do., 1<i>l.</i>,
a pair of the red Argus pheasants, 3<i>l.</i>; a flying squirrel, 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>; a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
flying fox, 5<i>s.</i>; a vulture, 2<i>l.</i> Although the price of birds for sale (not
set up) is so high, he would give but little for them, and appeared to
think 3<i>l.</i> for a pair of moonal pheasants, cock and hen, would be a very
great sum. The charges for setting up are extra.</p>
